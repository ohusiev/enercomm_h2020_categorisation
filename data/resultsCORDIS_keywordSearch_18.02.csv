58,MiniStor,Minimal Size Thermal and Electrical Energy Storage System for In-Situ Residential Installation,869821,"The EU building stock has large potential to increase its energy efficiency with solutions that can be integrated to existing dwellings and through different measures. One of them is optimizing the use and management of thermal energy by allowing it to be stored, levelling demand peaks and increasing use of renewables affected by intermittency such as solar-based heating. The MiniStor project aims at designing and producing a novel compact integrated thermal storage system for achieving sustainable heating, cooling and electricity storage that can be adapted to existing systems in residential buildings. It is based on a high-performing CaCl2/NH3 (calcium chloride/ammonia) thermochemical material reaction combined with parallel hot and cold phase-change materials for flexibility and usage year-round. It also stores electrical energy in a Li-ion battery that responds to grid signals and can sell to the electrical grid. The system is managed by a smart Building Energy Management System that connects to the Internet of Things. The system can have as input energy obtained from a variety of renewable energy sources such as hybrid photovoltaic thermal panels. This arrangement is demonstrated and validated in four demonstration sites (Ireland, France, Greece and Hungary), testing its effectiveness at different local climatic conditions and facilitating market replication. The system provides stability, performance and use of at least 20 years, an estimated compact storage material volume of 0.72 m3, reduced net energy consumption in a building by at least 44% and a return-on-investment period of 6.7 years, using high energy density storage materials that reach storage densities up to 10.6 times higher than water.",2019-11-01,2024-04-30,54.0,SIGNED,7537745.07,8532202.24,['energy'],['energy'],"['building', 'energy consumption', 'smart', 'buildings']",4

In this context, is clear that the reduction of consumption in the residential sector should play an important role in energy efficiency programmes and policies as is stated in the recent Energy Efficiency Directive 2012/27/EU.Most energy efficiency measures implemented in Europe involved technological interventions. In contrast, everyday energy-consuming behaviours are largely habitual and therefore the potential of energy savings at home with actions focused in consumer behaviour is really promising. In this context the provision of feedback to consumers has resulted in really promising results, achieving savings in the range of 5-20%. But some limitations exists. The aim of this project is to fill the gaps and advanced in this context, being an essential preparatory activity for the future large scale demonstration of feedback methodologies.The key aim of this project is to develop an advanced and integral user-centred framework for the implementation of efficient energy feedback programmes in the domestic area. Our approach relies in the complete characterisation of the EU energy consumer, and the design of specific personalised actions tailored to each consumer pattern detected based on the use of natural language and emotional contents. NATCONSUMERS will set the scenario to allow strengthening the dialogue between the EU energy system stakeholders in order to define robustness methodologies exploiting to the maximum the potential of energy feedback approaches, filling the existing gaps not still covered by previous pilots and experiments.NATCONSUMERS consortium brings together representatives of all stakeholders and areas involved in the project.

228,EOLI FPS,Roof top wind turbine for urban areas,816706,"High electricity prices and the lowering costs of renewable technologies and energy storage are leading European energy consumers towards a distributed generation and self-consumption model. Electricity consumers are progressively turning into prosumers (producers & consumers) who decide at a given moment whether to buy electricity from the grid, to self-consume or even to export it to the grid. Moreover, European energy regulations require EU consumers to commit to clean and energy efficient objectives. For instance, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive requires all new buildings to be nearly zero-energy (NZEB) by the end of 2020 by reducing energy consumption and using renewable sources and all new public buildings to be NZEB by 2018. The most extended renewable energy in the world is wind power. However, wind power is not very common in urban areas where high speed laminar wind turns into a low speed turbulent one due to the existence of obstacles (buildings, houses, trees, structures, etc.). Traditional wind power turbines are not designed to work with low speed wind (2 m/s – 6m/s) and turbulent wind flows. Besides, traditional SWTs entail other serious problems such as the hazard of rotating machinery, vibrations, noise, the possibility of collapse atop buildings, blade shedding and visual impact. EOLI FPS is a patented rooftop vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) specifically designed to work under low speed and turbulent wind profiles such as the existing in urban environments. EOLIS FPS works perfectly with horizontal laminar wind but also take advantage of turbulent flows that adversely affect traditional wind turbines. Its internal rotor design facilitates the creation of vortexes out of the wind turbulence that drastically increases the driving force of the laminar wind. Besides EOLI FPS is safe, noiseless, does not vibrate and integrates aesthetically in the urban landscape.",2018-05-01,2018-08-31,4.0,CLOSED,50000.0,71429.0,['energy'],,"['energy consumption', 'nzeb', 'urban', 'buildings']",4

Developments in modern building concepts, such as sustainable low-energy consuming buildings, buildings with lightweight materials and open plan working environments, as well as the need to build in extremely noisy areas, require involvement of acoustic experts in order to successfully (re)design buildings without negatively impacting upon people’s health and well-being. Taking up current and future acoustic challenges requires innovative solutions based on a thorough understanding and mastering of modern methods and tools, as well as a holistic acoustic approach involving acoustic design, products and subjective evaluation. However, in the complex field of building acoustics, research activities typically are not holistic and have become slightly marginalised. As a consequence, there is a lack of building acoustics experts.To meet the future acoustic needs of the built environment, Acoutect is constructed around two objectives: 1) Establish a long-lasting European-wide training programme on building acoustics, 2) Launch an innovative research programme. With these objectives, Acoutect will equip ESRs with skills to ensure acoustic quality of modern and future building concepts, and with excellent perspectives for a career in industry or academia within the area of building acoustics. The training and supervision to reach these objectives is offered by the Acoutect consortium composed of 5 academic and 7 non-academic participants.

Space heating and air conditioning are seasonal thermal end-uses with a high residential electricity consumption. They are not stored at the buildings scale to allow peak shaving of the residential electricity consumption. These statements show the interest to develop appropriate thermal energy storages, suitable for buildings, to reduce the electricity bill of end-users. ComBioTES will thus develop a modular compact thermal energy storage (TES) solution for heating, hot tap water and cooling fully adapted for electricity load shifting.A first modular TES will be able to store hot tap water to be converted into ice storage during summer (cooling needs). A second compact latent TES, using high performances (ΔH≈260kJ/kg) bio-based non-aggressive PCM, will store high heating energy amount, for space heating or hot tap water demands. As thermal end-uses in buildings are different regarding seasonal needs, this concept combines the advantage of a modular TES (high utilization rate) with the high volumetric energy density of a latent TES using a bio-based PCM (high compactness: ≥ 100kWh/m3 ΔT=50°C).The ComBioTES consortium and associated External Advisory Board (Idex, Danfoss and Passive House) involve all relevant key players in energy storage and management: RTOs for development and testing infrastructure and SMEs for manufacturing & commercialization of the technology, and representative of potential customers and end users (building owners &operators).

Coordination between demand and supply side of energy policy is not targeted, and there is need to gather the evidence on the benefits of EE in ecological and socio-economic terms as well as on its interactions with the broader policy context and energy market. The EERAdata project aims to address this challenge by supporting policy decisions and related stakeholders with an organic set of instruments to prioritise investments in energy efficiency in the context of the European building stock and its potential for renovation.The EERAdata project will develop and test a decision-support tool to help local administrations in the collection and processing of their building and demographic data towards an assessment and prioritization of EE measures in planning, renovating and constructing buildings. The tool will be operationalized through a software application capable of merging data from various sources, formats and fields, which will then model and assess the impact of energy efficiency investment in buildings across several categories of impact, and against a range of supply-side measures.Partner municipalities will participate to the design of the tool and test its application in regional pilots. The pilots will be part of a wider process of stakeholder engagement aimed at ensuring the usefulness of the different instruments, their applicability across different geographical and economic contexts, and its adoption beyond the life-span of the project.

Recently, increasing attention has been paid to the possibility of a dark matter with mass between the keV and the GeV, whose search requires novel detection techniques, and signatures involving low energy collective excitations. I propose to apply the recently developed effective field theories for condensed matter to study the interaction between light dark matter and the collective excitations of the detector. In particular, I propose to investigate possible two-dimensional detectors via two new signatures: the excitation of out-of-plane phonons and of electron density waves due to the interaction with dark matter. The effective field theory approach to condensed matter has the advantage of being independent on the complicated details of the microscopic physics, and of being formulated in a quantum field theory language, a framework very familiar to particle physicists. For these reasons, the present proposals has the potential of addressing a key question in modern physics, while bridging the gap between the high energy nature of the question about dark matter and the condensed matter issues related to its detectability. If accepted, the program will be carried out at New York University (NYU) for the first two years, and at Sapienza University of Rome for the third one. These institutions are perfectly complementary for what concerns the successful implementation of the program. NYU hosts world leading experts in dark matter model building and phenomenology, while Sapienza hosts a research program in the design and realization of detectors for light dark matter that is at the forefront the international research on the topic.

Therefore, the sustainability of our planet depends critically on a smart and energy-efficient operation of cities. Wireless communication technologies arise as one of the main enablers to reach this goal. For example, services and applications such as intelligent transportation, industry automation, and mobile healthcare will require to accommodate a vast number of heterogeneous and battery-limited wireless devices connecting asynchronously and sporadically to the network. This is commonly known as the massive connectivity problem. Since traditional wireless communication technologies were not designed to support this kind of services and applications, there is a need for a profound theoretical study of this problem.The main objective of MASCOT is to characterize, from an information-theoretic perspective, the fundamental limits and tradeoffs of the asynchronous massive connectivity problem. To this end, I will derive in the outgoing phase at MIT nonasymptotic bounds and asymptotic expansions characterizing these limits. In the return phase at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, I will then explore different strategies to efficiently and accurately compute the nonasymptotic bounds derived at MIT. During the course of the project, I will elaborate guidelines about how future wireless communication schemes must be designed, and I will adapt existing schemes according to these guidelines. The proposed training activities during the fellowship are fundamental for the correct achievements of MASCOT as well as to secure my future career goals.

The development of performant wind farms is pending upon the performance of each turbine composing the wind farm, and on the optimal harvesting of the local wind resources. A wind park performance is nowadays predicted assuming standard profiles of mean incoming velocity, turbulence intensities and scales, etc. corresponding to standard terrain topographies and atmospheric conditions.One main limitation of such standards is that the assumed flow and turbulence properties were established to fit databases gathered on a limited number of locations, which are by definition not representative of the quite various terrain configurations nor local micro-meteorological situations that can be met in practice. This is a concern for complex terrains and is furthermore hampering the implementation of wind turbines in urban environments, which constitutes nevertheless an important component of future environmentally-friendly Smart Cities thanks to the favorable local flow accelerations, pressure build-up, canyon effects, etc. offered by an urban canopy.The ambition of this multi-disciplinary training platform is the development and application of advanced meso/microscale atmospheric models and the assessment of the impact of real terrain and local atmospheric effects on the predicted aerodynamic performance, structural dynamics and noise emissions.

Caused by low household income, high energy bills, and low dwelling energy efficiency, energy poverty has traditionally been associated with the inability of households to meet their heating needs during winter. However, up to the 19% of households declared not being comfortably cool in summer. Nine of the 10 warmest years have occurred since 2005, with the last five years comprising the five hottest. Not to mention this 2019 June has been the hottest on record. Climate change is increasing both the severity and frequency of extreme hot weather and heat waves and in dense urban areas, these heatwave episodes will be combined with the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, worsening city centres temperatures which will negatively impact human health and wellbeing. Thus, cooling needs and overheating risk need to be incorporated into the energy poverty equation. The project COOLtoRISE aims to reduce summer energy poverty incidence among European households improving their indoor thermal habitability conditions and reducing their energy needs during the hot season, which will decrease their exposure to heat and heat-related health risks. Not all households have an air conditioning system and it is known that energy poor households make a restrictive use of heating and cooling as they cannot afford associated energy bills. However, raising awareness on summer energy poverty and implementing actions to mitigate it will have a double benefit on European households. First, heat exposure of energy poor households will be reduced by increasing indoor thermal conditions, which will decrease in their risk to suffer heat related diseases.

Mitigation and adaptation actions that enhance the resilience of cities need to be based on a sound understanding and quantification of the drivers of urban transformation and settlement structures, human and urban vulnerability, and of local and global climate change. Copernicus, as the means for the establishment of a European capacity for Earth Observation (EO), is based on continuously evolving Core Services. A major challenge for the EO community is the innovative exploitation of the Copernicus products in dealing with urban sustainability towards increasing urban resilience. Due to the multidimensional nature of urban resilience, to meet this challenge, information from more than one Copernicus Core Services, namely the Land Monitoring Service (CLMS), the Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), the Climate Change Service (C3S) and the Emergency Management Service (EMS), is needed. Furthermore, to address urban resilience, the urban planning community needs spatially disaggregated environmental information at local (neighbourhood) and city scales. Such information, for all parameters needed, is not yet directly available from the Copernicus Core Services mentioned above, while several elements - data and products - from contemporary satellite missions consist valuable tools for retrieving urban environmental parameters at local scale.The H2020-Space project CURE (Copernicus for Urban Resilience in Europe) is a joint effort of 10 partners from 9 countries that synergistically exploits the above Copernicus Core Services to develop an umbrella cross-cutting application for urban resilience, consisting of individual cross-cutting applications for climate change adaptation/mitigation, energy and economy, as well as healthy cities and social environments, at several European cities. These cross-cutting applications cope with the required scale and granularity by also integrating or exploiting third-party data, in-situ observations and modelling. CURE uses DIAS (Data and Information Access Services) to develop a system capable of supporting operational applications and downstream services across Europe. The CURE system hosts the developed cross-cutting applications, enabling its incorporation into operational services in the future. CURE is expected to increase the value of Copernicus Core Services for future emerging applications in the domain of urban resilience, exploiting also the improved data quality, coverage and revisit times of the future satellite missions. Thus, CURE will lead to more efficient routine urban planning activities with obvious socioeconomic impact, as well as to more efficient resilience planning activities related to climate change mitigation and adaptation, resulting in improved thermal comfort and air quality, as well as in enhanced energy efficiency. The CURE impact is maximized by developing synergies with EuroGEOSS and Climate-KIC, as well as by exploring the conditions under which, specific CURE outcomes could be integrated into the operational Copernicus service portfolio. The added value and benefit expected to emerge from CURE is related to transformed urban governance and quality of life, because it is expected to provide improved and integrated information to city administrators, hence effectively supporting strategies for resilience planning at local and city scales, towards the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and the New Urban Agenda for Europe.",2020-01-01,2022-12-31,36.0,SIGNED,2696337.9,2805012.0,['energy'],,"['urban', 'cities', 'city', 'climate', 'community', 'neighbourhood']",6

However, environmentally sustainable facades are insufficient to create resilient societies. In seismic hazard zones, façade performance and serviceability can be severely impacted by earthquakes. Façade damage can occur even at low seismic intensities, leading to potential life-safety threat and substantial socio-economic losses. Safer façade systems are thus urgently needed, and SAFE-FACE addresses this need. Damage-control details and sustainable techniques are integrated to develop earthquake-proof sustainable facades for mid-rise new/built residential/office buildings. Moreover, the common façade design is advanced by integrating the seismic study.

It is also a key challenge for the20-20-20 strategy of the EU.Sustainable housing starts with 'near zero-energy' buildings, i.e. homes that are so well insulated that it becomes easy toproduce more renewable energy on site than what is consumed.Today, house construction in Europe is mainly performed by craftsmen who are small local builders and who work withtraditional technics and who are not keen to invest on research and development of Modern Methods of Construction(MMC). As a consequence, it remains very difficult for consumers and investors to buy 'plus energy' houses in Europe (costsand lack of offer due to lack of know-how).The objective of the project is to provide to local builders the products and the tools so that they can offer to their customers'nearly zero-energy' buildings with guaranteed performance and cost controls.To do so, ECOXIA has developed the concept of """"Smart Envelope"""". Built in the ideal conditions of the factory, the envelopeis installed in a 'Plug & Play' way on site in one day.

2025,AIRCRANE,New Concrete-Towers Assembly system for taller Wind Turbines.,804858,"Skyscrapers building technology marked a turning point in the construction sector: Due to the great heights of those buildings, the only way to build them is with a crane which rises in the manner the skyscraper does. Inspired by that idea, we developed the AIRCRANE SYSTEM. The wind energy sector currently has a main objective: decrease the Levelized Cost of produced Energy (LCoE), in order to be comparable to other energy sources in the coming years. The strategies to decrease are mainly concentrated in two action groups: Reduce the cost of wind turbines and capture as much energy as possible.  Regarding the second group, manufacturers are convinced the best way is to create more powerful turbines (up to 8 MW) and install the nacelle and rotor at greater heights, where the wind blows harder and there are less turbulences. The market requires taller towers, supporting heavier loads on top as well. The only alternative, due to steel tower's limitations, is to make at least the lower part with concrete. But the concrete weak point is its weight, which requires the use of largest crawlers and cranes: very expensive machines and with a limited number of units worldwide. The AIRCRANE SYSTEM is a brand new technology that serves to assembly concrete wind-turbine towers, with theoretically infinite height: the Aircrane system is based on a external self-climbing crane which rises as the construction of the tower does, once its completed and built, the system will lift the nacelle and blades. There are two main advantages: (1) Radically reduce current construction costs in the tallest concrete towers, and additionally (2) open a new market-niche, being able to construct towers with no height limits.

This is a big problem, as currently there are 3.2M wheelchair users and 40M people in Europe that cannot walk without aid. To solve out this matter, platform lifts (able to carry a wheel chair) and stairlifts where created. However, this kind of machines present some problems at the time of its use, from which the most important one is their high consumption of energy, which makes them machines expensive to maintain. This consumption increases in an exponential way when the number of steps is high (>3 floors), being evident in the electricity bill. Other limitations are their big dimensions (not suitable for stairs < 1m), the disturbing noise of their motors, and the low speed (7’ to complete 4 floors!).In 2015, Extrema, a leader in accessibility systems, started developing Slim+, a platform stairlift with the smallest size and the lowest energy consumption of the market (50% less), which will allow to do more steps with the same motor, in narrow places and in a more sustainable and secure (improved electronic system) and silent (<60Db) way. The main innovative components developed include: new breaking system, new material for key components, novel stabilizing system and improved electronic device.A first prototype has been developed and tested at lab level (TRL6), however there are several activities to be done to improve the performance of current prototype to reach the market.Slim+ emerges in response to the demands in terms of energy consumption for platform lifts, with the purpose of widespread accessibility and mobility to all European citizens, especially in urban areas.

In contrast to electric and fossil fuel fired heaters, pellet stoves offer renewable heating for single rooms or low energy houses. However, while pellet stoves typically achieve low pollutant emissions during pre-commercial testing, these emissions often surpass certification limits when users operate them at home. Current solutions involve installation of extra filters that can double the investment costs of the entire heating system.RIKA, European market leader in wood stoves, aims at a significant extension of its product portfolio by the final development and commercialization of cleanFIRE. It constitutes a milestone in pellet-based space heating because it enables for the first time an almost zero CO, OGC and PM emission free combustion without the application of extra dust filters. cleanFIRE’s controlled transformation of the pellets into combustible gas forms its innovation core (as verified by tests performed using its gasifier and burner prototypes). In this project the new technology shall be further optimised in order to pass type testing at project end. Leveraging on EU climate targets, our innovation and current market consolidation with other pellet and logwood stoves, we will start cleanFIRE’s commercialization in 2022 targeting homeowners looking for 1) the replacement of an oil/gas/coal-fuelled or oversized heating appliance, and 2) those aiming to buy a new space heating appliance.

In that sense, the solution that we propose using 3D thermal images taken by UAVs is actually the only way to detect such losses on the roof and top of the walls. In addition,  by the utilization of innovative vision technologies we will be able to produce 3D-reconstruction of buildings and structures from images from drones in which thermal imaging overlay will be applied to generate precise 3D models of objects with augmented temperature and visible information.

However, the growth of the industry is hampered by their low profit margins and additional investments and innovations are needed to improve process efficiency.The key problem in migrating towards green production is the biomass recalcitrance, which is known to be a major bottleneck in the lignocellulosic biomass conversion process. The initial steps common to several biorefinery process pipelines, the extraction and sugar conversion process (saccharification), can account to as much as 40-45% of the process costs. Therefore, biorefineries can achieve extensive economic impact by addressing this part of their process through a simple business development effort.We recently made a breakthrough and obtained a biomass less recalcitrant to bioconversion into fermentable sugars. Results show that introduction of only 5% Callose in genetically modified poplars led to 90% more fermentable sugars released during saccharification experiments without any growth penalty, a frequent drawback for such innovations. In practice, this proposes added value to biorefineries through decreased raw material intake, improved throughput and improved yield. For instance, bioethanol production could expect a linear throughput increase (in the 50-90% range) with the same material intake. Moreover, the more manageable pretreatment process will also experience improved energy efficiency.In the PoC we will carry out technical proof-of-concept and commercialisation planning activities to improve the maturity, and bringing our patented innovation closer to the markets with applications ranging from biofuels, advanced materials and bioplastics to specialty chemicals.

Resolving this necessitates the deployment and penetration of several solutions, a key on being demand response, which in turn depends on the role of prosumers with regards to their engagement with the energy system. Demand flexibility from residential buildings is the main untapped source of flexibility currently in the market and promises significant flexibility potential, especially taking into account the electrification of heat and transport mega-trends.

Moreover, aviation history shows that disruption is extremely difficult (both technologically & from the certification point of view) & that the most adopted solutions are usually modern revisits of reliable designs. This is the approach we are taking with our novel aircraft.aEro2 is built on the success of our aEro 1 electric conventional take off & landing aerobatic plane. The eVTOL aEro2 will use a modular hybrid-electric power system. Three key features differentiate it  from the competition. It is:- built on proven aircraft designs;- reuses all electric propulsion already validated on our TRL 9 aEro 1;- Can take off/land both as a conventional fixed-wing aircraft & as a rotor craft.Uniquely among the VTOL manufacturers, we chose a more reliable strategy to bringing an electric aircraft to reality. We built & tested aEro 1—a fully electric conventional airplane using a retrofitted Silence Twister. We validated that all systems work as expected in 60+ hours of flight time. Now we are building aEro 2—the proper VTOL. aEro 2 is a 500kg 2-seater aircraft that can travel at 320km/h up to 800km, land and take off vertically and produces very low noise.

VPPs need to support not only the promotion of intermittent renewables (RES) but also the integration of all Distributed Energy Resources (DER) into the full scope of grid operations. Such a leap raises challenges: optimal combination of DER and RES in a new generation of VPPs is needed to jointly provide grid supportive flexibility with slow reaction time known from day-head and intra-day markets, as well as real-time reaction to provide fast frequency and inertial response and dynamic-phasor driven voltage control ancillary services. In a nutshell, in a DER-based power electronics-driven network VPPs need to play all the roles that synchronous machines play in a traditional system. Flexibility can be provided by going beyond electrochemical storage and exploring opportunities offered by Power2X or inverters.

Trapping airborne particles by water droplets is one of the most widely used methods to reduce the particle concentration in polluted air. However, generating intensive micro-droplets via spraying or ultrasonic atomization normally requires specialized equipment and a large amount of energy. In this project, I propose a novel and cost-effective approach to capture particles by utilizing abundant self-jumping droplets generated during condensation on a superhydrophobic surface. Since the condensation process is ubiquitous and can be found in various heat transfer devices such as air conditioners, the proposed strategy will significantly reduce the expenses and energy costs for particle removal. In particular, to enhance the particle trapping rate, I intend to explore the rational superhydrophobic surface topography that allows continuous jumping-droplet condensation. I will first analyze the condensing droplet wetting dynamics using the cutting-edge confocal microscopy developed by the host lab. The results obtained will help to optimize the surface structures to achieve the durable condensate repellency. Next, I will investigate the effects of jumping droplet characteristics on the particle-droplet interaction from a single-droplet perspective. Finally, I will use my expertise in thermal physics to quantitatively correlate global condensation heat transfer and particle trapping performance.

The EU has set itself climate and energy targets to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions progressively up to 2050. Commercial kitchens, are intense energy users and represent the biggest energy consumers per square foot of all commercial buildings. Typically, 20% of a food service business’ annual energy costs are wasted through the use of energy inefficient equipment. Improving the efficiency of commercial kitchen equipment can result in savings of 10-30%, depending upon the technologies installed. Ovens represent one of the most energy demanding pieces of equipment. A minimum of 20.000kWh could be saved yearly, if ovens were replaced by high efficiency equipment in commercial kitchens. Main limitations from most advanced ovens on the market include: 1) energy is wasted as heat, and the majority is released into the kitchen warming up the kitchen (cooling of the kitchen is thus needed, thus further energy required), 2) notable food weight loss and too dry resulting cooked foods, 3) long cooking times, 4) non-automated cooking (automatic cooking programs greatly increase the kitchen staff’s productivity, provide constant results and no cooking training is required), 5) pyrolytic automatic cleaning requires too much energy. To overcome all of these problems CB s.r.l has created Smart Cooking; a low energy infrared oven which uses 60% less energy than convection ovens (no energy is wasted as heat, no energy is needed to cool the kitchen), reduces cooking time by 15-50%, cuts food weight loss by 15%, and incorporates automated cooking programs and self-cleaning technology (50% less energy used than pyrolitic ovens).

However, there are a number of technical and economic barriers the small wind industry needs to overcome in order to become fully competitive. These include low performances in urban environments with slow and turbulent winds, high noise levels, need for reliable safety systems to avoid over-speeding, risks to birds and high upfront investments for the purchase and installation of the technology. Existing market solutions only cover a certain range of wind speeds and have low performances in slow winds. They also cause uncomfortable noise with levels that can reach 60dBA - above WHO standards (40 – 55 dBA) - while posing a collision hazard for birds during flight. In economic terms, the average final installed costs of a small wind turbine are around €10,000 to €15,000. SEESWIND is the first technology in the small wind market that offers solutions to cover the full range of winds and user demands thanks to its modular and easy to install (plug & play) configuration, ensuring a silent (0 dBA), efficient and safe performance while reducing by 10-40% the overall final cost for the user.

However, the technology used is static and dated: it chills the water to a very low temperature so that it can copewith extremely hot weather, irrespective of the actual prevailing conditions. Keeping the chiller water colder than it needs tobe leads to excess electricity consumption. Elencon has invented and developed a unique plug-and-play technology: usingIoT sensors and machine learning, the system analyses a building's thermodynamic map and usage patterns andcombines this with hourly weather forecasts and dynamic electricity pricing to set the chiller water to an optimal temperature,which is almost always higher than current set minimums.

This method does not always comply with the standards, polluting soils and watercourses. On top, the extension of Europe dry regions could increase to 26% if the average temperature rises 2 degrees Celsius. New flushing toilets incorporating less litres at their tank still don’t solve the problem. For the reasons expressed above, new approaches of feces and urine management at urban level need to be considered in order to ensure natural areas’ preservation, improve water/energy management and reduce its consumption. Dry toilets are a part of the solution, but most of them are conceived for individual houses or isolated cabins but not for storey buildings. In response, SANISPHERE, a French SME leader at dry toilets with a patented urine and feces separation system and composting method based on earthworms created SANIBUILDING, an unique method able to be used at storey buildings no matter the number of storey, with a negligible use of water and electricity with the possibility to transform feces in high quality compost used for gardening, with a very easy maintenance.

UDO has been tested in two vehicles’ prototypes, one of a kick-bike and another of a bicycle, and has proven its very low energy consumption (1 Wh/km), big autonomy (up to 120 km) and usability.54% of the worlds’ population lives in cities and almost half commute to work by car, generating 40% of CO2 emissions. Car user’s experience is far from being efficient as up to 101 hours in congestion can be wasted and € 10.000/year in costs can be spent. Commuting by bike is a great way to avoid traffic jam, contributes to a healthier city, increases the appeal of public transport and save money whilst exercising. However, current offerings (traditional and electric vehicles) presents drawbacks that still prevent commuters to switch. Nowadays solutions for cities’ sustainable mobility are bicycles (but the physical effort required and the need to shower afterwards still prevents many commuters) and electric bicycles (discouraged by many users as they feel dangerous, are heavy and have low autonomy as they must be charged every 15-40 km).

The data is automatically collected and can be utilized for controlling heating, cooling and ventilation systems of indoors. Active radio interface enables long range communication and long term data collection with WiFi or a similar base station. The proposed concept of smart windows replaces several conventional sensors with a distributed sensor network that is integrated invisibly into windows.

3854,USHPP,Unassisted photochemical water oxidation to solar hydrogen peroxide production,892213,"The growing demand for clean energy, and serious nature of global warming are unquestionable. Moreover, the finite nature of fossil fuel reserves and the increasing pace of climate change mean that we must find and harness clean and sustainable energy sources. H2O2 can be one such energy source because it is one of the most potent fuels, generating more energy than any other fuel without generating any pollutant. Although the green hydrogen economy is projected as a solution to clean energy demand, it suffers from storage problems due to the low volumetric energy density in the gas phase. However, there is no storage issue associated with liquid form H2O2. Undoubtedly, the photochemical O2 reduction route has great potential for H2O2 production but the systematic requirements limit its commercialization. However, there is no photocatalyst reported so far, which oxidized the water to H2O2 without any assistance (without the use of a sacrificial agent, external bias, oxygen supply, etc.). This project USHPP (Unassisted photochemical water oxidation to solar hydrogen peroxide production) is designed to address all these problems by synthesizing a stable, shielded, and water oxidizing PC for commercially viable and eco-friendly H2O2 production route. Furthermore, the spontaneous reduction of H+ ions to H2 in conduction band in the proposed  USHPP project will resolve the major problem of gases separation associated with photochemical H2 production in powder system (as there will be two separate phases: H2O2 in liquid (oxidative product), and H2 in the gas phase (reductive product)). Further, the success of this project also opens the possibility of simultaneous production of H2O2 via H2O oxidation at valence band, and O2 reduction at conduction band, which will increase the H2O2 production rate without utilizing any sacrificial agent. The best use of in-situ solar H2O2 production system in combination with biocatalysts will bring multidisciplinary aspect to USHPP.",2021-01-01,2023-01-18,25.0,SIGNED,224933.76,224933.76,['energy'],,"['energy demand', 'climate']",2

Relying on district heating systems for heat generation is the most effective solution in densely populated areas. However, many district heating systems (DHS) are highly energy inefficient and need to be modernized. Considering that the predominant energy sources used are still fossil fuels (oil, gas or coal) makes interventions ever more urgent. Both statements hold especially for East European countries where old, inefficient district heating systems, mostly fueled by fossil sources, urgently need to be modernized. The unique feature of KeepWarm is its combination of concrete work at pilot systems and its close alignment with national and European multipliers to disseminate this experience broadly. The latter incudes close interaction with potential investors and fund managers to increase the likelihood that KeepWarm business plans receive the necessary funding. The project promotes EU goals of improved and environmental friendly heating and cooling but adapts its exploitation strategy to distinct national windows of opportunities.KeepWarm will work intensively with DHS in seven countries (i) to increase the energy efficiency of these systems; and (ii) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by promoting a switch from fossil to renewable fuels. This is most urgently needed in the case of large-scale DH systems that are mostly found in Eastern Europe, the focus of this project. Likewise, it is important to ensure that existing DHS that run on renewables do not switch back to fossil fuels.",2018-04-01,2020-12-31,33.0,CLOSED,2098488.5,2098497.5,['energy'],,"['energy demand', 'district']",2

In particular, the MIRACLE project will construct and test a revolutionary Photonic Meta-Concrete (PMC) whose response to light will be engineered for exhibiting radiative cooling ability; i.e. the PMC will be able to expel heat from buildings to the outer space without any extra energy consumption. Though this ambitious challenge can have a big impact in the Nearly-Zero-Energy-Buildings (NZEB) uptake,  the concept of PMC transcends this particular application, with multiple implications in avenues like solar cell-technology or communication technologies, for example. Radiative cooling technology utilizes the atmospheric transparency window to passively dissipate heat from the Earth to outer space. This technology has attracted wide interest from both fundamental and applied sciences, due to its a priori potential in multiple applications like building cooling, renewable energy harvesting, or even dew water production. However, currently the development of this technology is in a bottleneck, where the scientific ideas have negligible potential impact in any real-world energy solution. In this context, the MIRACLE consortium proposes a considerable advance in the state-of-the-art because it will address for the first time an effective and fully scalable solution based on steel microfibre reinforced concrete ! The idea of MIRACLE is to propose new designs where an ordered arrangement of the steel microfibres can work in combination with hierarchical porous structure of concrete as a PMC. For this challenging objective, advanced optimization methods based on deep learning technologies will be employed at the design level, while the fabrication will rely on an inverse-phase methodology where micro-patterned concrete mould  will be produced by two-photon-polymerization (2PP).",2021-02-01,2025-01-31,48.0,SIGNED,3192466.25,3192466.25,['energy'],['energy'],"['energy consumption', 'nzeb', 'buildings', 'building']",4

This is valid for e.g. self-driving cars but also for industrial data centres. However, the limiting factor nowadays (and for future scaling) is the data transfer within the system, specifically, by the factors: bandwidth, power, and space. In fact, so-called interconnects cause 30% of power consumption in data centres today (and data centres account for currently 2%, in the future estimated 8%, of electricity worldwide). At higher speeds, the electricity cost of currently used copper links already dominates over the hardware cost. Due to this and their unsustainable signal loss, copper links are increasingly replaced by optical solutions, e.g. vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL), which provide negligible frequency dependent loss, a high bandwidth and 10-times lower power consumption.

4105,LIGHTYEAR,Developing the electric car that charges itself: Lightyear One,848620,"Lightyear, an international team of 90 engineers including triple winners of the World Solar Challenge, experienced engineers (180+ years) from the aerospace, racing and automotive industry (e.g. ASML, Tesla, Ferrari and Inalfa) and alumni of the Eindhoven University of Technology, develops the first commercially available electric solar car in the world that charges itself: the Lightyear One. The extremely efficient family car will be able to drive for weeks or even months on self-generated solar energy. The engineers started from the rationale that the car should be incredibly efficient, in order to make an independent entity having its own energy source. To achieve this, Lightyear had to minimize the car’s energy consumption and maximize its energy input, by using four inwheel motors instead of one rigid motor, lowering the total mass of the car by using lightweight biobased materials, redesign to improve aerodynamics, developing a new battery pack; integrating their in-house custom developed solar panels on the roof and the bonnet of the car. Result: a car that excellences in driving range, in weight, in energy consumption, sustainability and operation costs compared to market's-state-of-the-art. Range anxiety, dependency on energy (charging) infrastructure and the use of non-renewable/inefficient energy sources to charge your car will belong to the past. In this project, Lightyear aims to develop, validate and demonstrate the first Lightyear One and associated assembly line, bringing their innovation from TRL 5/6 to 8.  Lightyear expects to produce the first 10 signature cars in 2020, and start serial production from 2021 onwards. EBITDA is expected to turn positive in 2021 with a fivefold increase of FTEs.

4106,SRec BIPV,Smart Reconfigurable photovoltaic modules for Building Integrated PhotoVoltaic applications,751159,"The use of PhotoVoltaic (PV) modules in the built environment has rapidly been growing during the last years, especially in Europe. Building Integrated PhotoVoltaic (BIPV) modules cannot always be placed under ideal circumstances due to restrictions arising from the building profile. Therefore, non-ideal orientation and inhomogeneous irradiation resulting from shadowing from obstacles will often create non-uniform illumination. This, in turn, creates current mismatch among the different PV modules as well as among the different cells each PV module is made of. This mismatch can cause a dramatic reduction of the overall PV module power. Since current PV module technologies, both standard and smart, are not able to efficiently and effectively face the mismatch issue in highly non-uniform applications such as BIPV, innovative PV module technologies are required. The aim of this proposal is to realize a first fully functional demonstrator of Reconfigurable Smart PV (RSPV) module, able to dynamically change the electrical interconnection between the PV cells in real-time as the PV module adapts to its environment, and to develop the integrated intelligence. Both hardware and software will be designed ad hoc in order to balance additional cost and energy harvesting in non-ideal conditions. Such a solution will increase the energy harvesting in BIPV applications, where non-uniform operating conditions often occur.",2018-03-01,2020-02-29,24.0,TERMINATED,172800.0,172800.0,['energy'],,"['building', 'smart']",2

4159,Life-Cycle,Life-like Supramolecular Materials based on Reaction Cycles with Designed Feedback,757910,"This “Life-Cycle” ERC proposal aims to develop a new class of artificial supramolecular materials that are kept in sustained non-equilibrium states by continuous dissipation of chemical fuels. Supramolecular polymers in current artificial materials stick together through weak reversible bonds that can be exchange by thermal energy. In contrast, natural supramolecular polymers such as those in the cytoskeletal network use chemical fuels such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to achieve an incredible adaptivity, motility, growth, and response to external inputs. Development of chemically fueled artificial supramolecular polymers should therefore lead to more life-like materials that could perform functions so far reserved only for living beings. The proposed materials are based on supramolecular reaction cycles that have both positive and negative feedback in order to achieve emergent properties, such as oscillations and waves. Two different approaches are used: i) supramolecular polymers that are fueled by redox reactions, and ii) enzyme-switchable supramolecular polymers that consume one of the natural fuels, namely ATP. The proposed polymers self-assemble cooperatively, which is used as a positive feedback mechanism. Using other co-assembling species we can engineer negative feedback in our reaction cycles to obtain unique supramolecular dynamics. Since the building blocks react, but also self-assemble they have built-in chemomechanical properties, much like in living materials such as the cytoskeleton. First we study the temporal behavior (part A) of our reaction cycles in well-stirred environments. Next, we move to non-stirred conditions (part B), where spatiotemporal behavior can be studied. And lastly, we develop free-standing non-equilibrium interactive materials based on our reaction cycles (part C).

It is however always accompanied by glare control solutions to manage the amount of light and heat entering the building. VideowindoW has developed a revolutionary alternative to conventional blinds or awning, which eliminates the choice between daylight or transparency. Multiple transparent modules are integrated into the glass façade, each module consisting of tiny LCD-segments (‘pixels’). The transparency of these pixels is independently controlled at very high speed. This enables the transformation of the glass façade into a transparent media platform. The content shown in the glass façade simultaneously serves as glare control. By using light sensors in combination with a proprietary algorithm the density of the content is calculated to yield the required degree of transparency. VideowindoW reduces energy consumption up to 30% (of which 20% climate control and 10% interior lighting). These savings help customers achieve sustainability goals. Customers now even have the opportunity to turn glass into a source of revenue, as it is transformed into potential advertising space by VideowindoW.The proposed SME-Instrument project is aimed at the European scale-up of the VideowindoW technology towards high-traffic locations, such as public transport hubs).

Serving as the research arm of the SET-Plan, the EERA Joint Programmes are developing into a sort of “Virtual European Institute on Energy Research”, working in open collaboration with innovation and industrial initiatives and stakeholders. In order to provide support to the different EERA bodies (Executive Committee, Joint Programmes) and ensure efficient operations, the EERA Secretariat was established in 2010. The main objective of the EERA Secretariat is to support EERA as key actor in the implementation of the integrated SET Plan by:•Accelerated EU delivering on the SET-Plan priorities •Ensure a more transparent and better functioning EERA•Strengthen EERA structuring effects on the energy research community",2016-09-01,2018-08-31,24.0,CLOSED,600000.0,1150308.75,['energy'],,"['smart', 'community']",2
4331,E2P2,Eco Edge Prime Power,101007219,"Further digitalisation of society over the next decade demands infrastructure that is closer to the consumer as the shift in consumption requires data services at the edge of the digital networks. The key to meeting this demand is to rollout digital infrastructure that penetrates urban areas in support of this digital future. The problems associated with powering urban data centres hinges on the challenges of electrical power distribution within cities. This project aims to address these problems by creating a proof of concept (POC) alternative prime power source that employs fuel cell technologies for on-site power generation, which are efficient, quiet, showing reduced environmental impact and negligible demand on the electrical grid. Fuel cells have been around since the Apollo space program and can operate on different fuels like natural gas, hydrogen and propane (LPG). Fuel cells are electrochemical energy converters with efficiencies that exceed conventional power plants, already at small scale. The concept of connecting fuel cells to gas networks to power resilient urban and edge data centres overcomes the need to have backup generation in such areas, thus reducing the emissions and noise impact.The main objectives of the proposed project are to:1.Define the fuel cell prime power concept for data centres.2.Create an authoritative open standard for fuel cell adaption to power data centres.3.Demonstrate and validate a POC fuel cell based prime power module for data centres.4.Collect extensive operational data from running fuel cells as prime power for data centres. 5.Analyse the combined social, environmental and commercial impact for the European market.6.Evaluate opportunities for improved energy efficiency and waste heat recovery.The project strongly anticipates opportunities for the European fuel cell suppliers to increase their uptake across multiple markets with improved energy efficiency and cost effectiveness.",2021-01-01,2023-12-31,36.0,SIGNED,2499715.5,3521477.5,['energy'],,"['urban', 'cities']",2

Furthermore it is predicted that the world will need 30 terawatts (TW) of energy by 2050 which must come from renewables.  The EU Renewable Energy Directive in conjunction with the Energy Performance in Buildings Directive has set targets to increase energy efficiency in excess of 32.5% by 2030. In answer to these challenges there is a need to develop new materials for solar energy conversion (photovoltaics) and low energy lighting. The three key challenges in developing new photovoltaics for the conversion of solar energy to electricity are: high efficiency, low cost and long life.   In this context, this project aims to develop and study of new multifunctional materials to act as hosts for semiconductor quantum dots and nanoparticles, and to use them in the manufacture and study of solar cells and LEDs. It combines the experience of the PI, Prof Gary Hix, in photonic materials and that of the fellow, Dr Konstantinos Papathanasiou in synthesis of porous materials, to deliver materials which will contribute to global and European Clean Energy objectives.

Our vision is to provide a contemporary energy supply that meets the requirements of the environment, society and the economy alike. HORIZON is a worldwide unparalleled retractable folding solar roof that can be utilised in already commercially exploited spaces such as parking lots, storage and logistics facilities, as it enables the production of solar power through dual usage. The dual usage of spaces preserves resources and allows for the production of solar power where it is needed most. The folding roof automatically avoids poor weather and retracts itself into a central garage. Due to this protective function the retractable folding solar roof is aesthetic, lightweight and economical. Horizon has been designed with the future in mind as it can be integrated into current and future trends such as IoT, smart mobility and smart grids. Our solution provides a solution to the increasing densification of our living spaces and eases the competition amongst industry, housing, cropland, recreational spaces and energy production. Horizon is a disruptive technology and it has no direct competing solutions which can achieve a similar dual function in the target markets. The two main applications of the folding solar roof are parking-logistics areas and wastewater treatment plants. The customers are municipalities, energy providers or land operators. High self-consumption remains at the centre for both segments, as well as additional benefits such as shade for vehicles, brand image or the compatibility with electro mobility charging stations. There is a technical potential of approximately 70MW on wastewater purification plants and 5GW on parking lots within the Swiss market.

Electricity and transport are the largest contributors to GHG emissions; the trend in transport toward electric vehicle will increase pressure on the electricity system and fundamentally change its dynamics. With producers focused on their legitimate business targets, and consumers focused on security of supply and low prices, the burden of decarbonizing electricity falls on policy makers as driving force, and on transport system operators (TSOs) as technical managers that ensure the safety and stability of supply.Grid stability is a delicate equilibrium, where some agents provide stability via ancillary services (regulating voltage and frequency) and others rely on that stability (consuming energy and/or disturbing the frequency due to embedded capacitors/impedances); power producers are usually stabilizers (synchronous turbines that provide inertia against sudden changes). Penetration of non-synchronous renewables such as Wind and PV threatens to disrupt the balance, especially in islands and poorly interconnected areas, as they provide power but rely on stability provided by others; this forces the system to have lots of synchronous generators idle just for stability, which is inefficient and costly.GRIDSOL wants to change the approach: we propose Smart Renewable Hubs, where a core of synchronous generators (CSP and biogas combined cycle HYSOL) is integrated with PV under a dynamic control system (DOME), self-regulating and providing ancillary grid services thanks to firm, flexible generation on a single output, tailored to a specific location, relieving pressure on the TSO.The project will research an advanced control (DOME) to ensure operation efficiency and grid stability with higher RES penetration, and a multi-tower concept for CSP cost reduction and efficiency improvement, to provide secure, clean and efficient electricity by getting the most of each renewable primary source.",2016-10-01,2019-11-30,38.0,CLOSED,3421447.5,3421447.5,['energy'],,"['smart', 'climate']",2

Until recently, the opacity of 3D porous media-the natural habitat of subsurface bacteria-had prevented in situ and in vivo imaging of bacterial dynamics in such environments. Recent experimental and theoretical breakthroughs at the host institution have led to the discovery that flows in natural porous media are chaotic in nature. Since chaotic mixing is known to yield and sustain strong chemical gradients at micro-scale, this discovery challenges the assumption of homogeneous nutrient distributions, broadly-used in current models of subsurface microbial processes. The goal of MicroMix is thus to explore the effect of chaotic mixing on bacterial growth and colonization in 3D porous media under positive stimuli (WP1: mixing-limited nutrient resources) and negative stimuli (WP2: antibiotic source, nutrient rerouting by bioclogging). To do so, we will  develop a novel bioreactor system, primarily based upon coupling high-resolution Laser Induced Fluorescence and optical index matching, which will allow us to obtain the first joint imaging of chemical landscapes and bacterial colonies in 3D porous media. The project builds upon the combined expertise of the ER in the field of biomicrofluidics, of the supervisor in mixing dynamics, and of the secondment supervisor on biofilm dynamics in porous media.

Currently it’s not, since the existing solutions do not provide energy at a competitive price level. PolarSol has developed the first solar heating system capable of operating around the year even in cold-climate conditions. Moreover, it provides energy that is cheaper than district heating! The innovation is based on the patented heat exchanger made from thin stainless steel sheet. This unique element serves as a core for all processes within a full-cycle hybrid system, including heating, cooling, waste heat recuperation, and energy storage. Using same element for multiple purposes allows customers significantly reduce investments, shorten payback time and increase ROI. For most of objects the payback time is 3-5 years, which is by far the industry record.The system has already been piloted in Finland, Estonia, Czech Republiс, Poland, Malta, Ukraine and Russia for a variety of objects including private houses, industrial plants, spas and multi-story buildings. The system is easily scalable and can be supplied both to B2C and B2B markets. However, so far PolarSol has paid little attention on focusing marketing and sales effort in order to attract as diverse customer base as possible. The diversity has provided us better opportunity to test different system modifications. One of the main goals of the project is to identify customer segments with the highest market potential with special emphasis on B2B market. This goal will be pursued in Phase 1 by means of market surveys and thorough analysis of available options.The whole delivery chain is so far mainly handled by PolarSol itself. The goal of Phase 2 is to develop the international network of partners and local representatives and build up effective sales and distribution channels. This will allow PolarSol better respond to the constantly growing demand for heat exchangers and concentrate on developing new clean energy solutions for global challenges.",2015-07-01,2015-12-31,6.0,CLOSED,50000.0,71429.0,['energy'],['energy'],"['buildings', 'climate', 'district']",3

Its main benefits stem from (1) reducing up to 15% on the electricity costs, (2) decreasing the associated CO2 emissions (1.5%), (3) maximizing the self-consumption of green electrical energy (solar, wind)  locally produced, and (4) contributing to stabilize the electricity distribution networks for providers. To complement these benefits we propose two unprecedented features: (1) an Energy Storage Management module, which will maximize the self-consumption of green sources of energy from a Battery Storage Energy System and (2) a Smart Grid Integration module, which will provide a virtual charge to balance the energy demand/response of electricity providers. The existing control technologies do not include any intelligence to implement an efficiency energy plan, and are mainly focused on centralized tools which are difficult to install and entail high initial investment and labour costs. Besides, no solution enables to predict the peak demand and maximizes the self-consumption of local green electrical energy.

Buildings play a key role in this transition as, on one hand they are responsible for approximately 40% of energy consumption and 36% of CO2 emissions in the EU  and, on the other hand, the potential engagement of consumers through the demand-response mechanisms. To enable this transformation, distribution grids will face news paradigms in the ways they operate relying more on flexibility smart grids with capacity to safely host more renewable energy sources (RES) and integrate new loads, such as power to heat/cold, power to gas/liquid and new technologies, as well as electric vehicles (EVs) while advancing in security of supply and affordability. Therefore, this global picture will demand the generation of a new concept of connected ecosystem between energy system players and consumers. Under this scenario, the project consortium accepted this challenge and offers to develop the “REDREAM Project”, which not only will enable the effective participation of the consumers/prosumers in the energy market, but also will drive a profound change turning traditional company’s value chain into value generation chain, based on a revolutionary Service Dominant Logic paradigm. The main objective of the REDREAM project is to effectively move the consumer (as a residential, industrial and tertiary consumer) participation to the centre of the energy market through an open and co-creative ecosystem where all stakeholders will actively interact.

This very technology will provide energy for wireless sensor networks monitoring the air in your city or the structural stability of buildings and large constructions remotely and sustainably, avoiding battery recharging or even replacing them. These are the challenges in micro energy harvesting from (local) ambient sources. Kinetic, thermal and solar energies are ubiquitous at our surroundings under diverse forms, but their relatively low intensity and intermittent availability limit their potential recovery by microscale devices. These restrictions call for multi-source energy harvesters working under two principles: 1) combining different single-source harvesters in one device, or 2) using multifunctional materials capable of simultaneously converting various energy sources into electricity.

This sector has huge untapped potential for energy efficiency and flexibility but the split incentive problem has so far prevented the use of performance-based approaches to realise these savings. SmartSPIN removes this barrier through an Energy Efficiency-as-a-Service (EEaaS) concept that couples the contractual agreements between tenants, building owners and energy efficiency providers with technologies for energy monitoring, management and measurement and verification (M&V), increasing transparency, credibility and persistence of savings. SmartSPIN brings together a consortium of leading experts from the whole value chain to develop the SmartSPIN business model toolkit: a set of tools and resources for stakeholders on both the supply side (energy service companies, M&V specialists, etc.) and the demand side (tenants, building owners etc.) of the value chain. Technical resources include data-based M&V tools for accurate baseline estimation and predictive algorithms for building operation and control available via an Application Programming Interface to use with any energy data visualisation platform. Non-technical resources include best practice guides for stakeholders looking to deploy the SmartSPIN business model, contractual templates for EEaaS, case studies and infographics to describe the key features to a non-technical audience. SmartSPIN will validate the toolkit through extensive stakeholder engagement and by demonstrating its effectiveness in the commercial rented sector in 3 pilot regions (Spain, Greece and Ireland). To maximise impact, SmartSPIN will train 350 stakeholders on the business model’s key features through a series of pan-European exploitation workshops and webinars who will become early adopters beyond the end of the project.",2021-09-01,2024-08-31,36.0,SIGNED,1996787.5,1996787.5,['energy'],['energy'],"['building', 'smart']",2

Regionally, RE uptake remains unequal and investment is not increasing at the necessary pace. RE’s potential remains unexploited particularly in addressing persistent energy access challenges and driving economic development.The increased use of RE in the power sector shows that the transition to RE is possible with effective policy and regulatory frameworks. But progress is hindered, in large part, by persisting myths about RE and the role they can play in the overall energy system. Scientific data and information, therefore, need to be complemented with stronger forms of communication, including communicating about the socio-economic benefits of renewables.

The success of this transition relies on the combination of energy efficiency and low carbon energy in all sectors of the economy. In particular, the industry and transport sector will need to rely more heavily on electricity to achieve this goal.  In all electricity mix scenarios up to 2050, one needs to rely on one or a combination of existing nuclear power plants, long term operation, new nuclear build and future nuclear systems. Safety and operability of any nuclear systems heavily relies on a defense in depth strategy where the integrity of structural material plays an essential role. Due to material availability and/or irradiation constraints, the use of small size specimen to obtain reliable measurement of the resistance to fracture is needed by the nuclear industry to comply with the amended Nuclear Safety Directive. Small size specimen fracture toughness measurement has already been shown possible. However, some effort is still requested to achieve European regulatory acceptance of this approach. The goal of this project is to join European and International effort to establish the foundation of small specimen fracture toughness validation and demonstration to achieve change in code and standards allowing to address the various national regulatory authority concerns.

A major part of the overall plant size and the energy demand of coil coating facilities is associated with the drying/curing process that occur inside a curing oven, which is the bottleneck concerning the increase of the production capacity. In this drying/curing process, organic solvents are vaporized from the applied liquid coating film and since they are flammable, the usually applied curing ovens with convective air drying technology have to be operated far below the Low Explosive Limit (LEL), due to safety constraints. ECCO proposes a novel solution for the curing oven operation, which can not only drastically increase the compactness and energetic efficiency of the system, but leads to an increased production flexibility due to a fuel-flexible, modular and potentially energetically self-sustainable process. The main idea is to heat the metal strip by IR-radiation and operate the curing oven well above the Upper Explosive Limit (UEL), thus, performing the drying and curing process in an atmosphere mainly consisting of the solvent vapours, which are used as fuel in IR radiant porous burners. This solution leads to a size/ production capacity ratio reduction of 70% and a reduction of investment and operating costs of at least 40% each.

The technology developed and proposed by PCMPro delivers breakthrough properties:• thanks to the development of the innovative PCM and to a compact innovative design, the energy density is 73 kWh/m3, much higher than competing technologies;• installing the storage unit on the ceiling area, 12 tubes can be packed per m2 using standard 50mm pipe brackets, giving a storage of 1.74 kWh/m2;• the application of an eutectic alloy leads to a constant charging and discharging temperature, with benefits in terms of conditioning quality and easiness in storage management;• as already demonstrated by the first pilot installations in a number of offices/shops and in an educational facility located at Coventry in U.K., the integration of TubeICE leads to a global energy consumption reduction within the range 10-40% depending on the location and the building properties, thanks to the maximization of free-cooling (and the consequent reduction of energy intensive mechanical cooling) and to the nighttime free storage.• TubeICE is maintenance free and assures a long durability (10 years and more).",2017-07-01,2017-10-31,4.0,CLOSED,50000.0,71429.0,['energy'],['energy'],"['energy consumption', 'positive', 'building']",3

As a consequence, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and Utilities are investigating new strategies and technologies for power flexibility. On the other hand, existing cogenerative CCs are usually constrained by thermal user demand, hence can provide limited services to the grid. At the same time, CHP plants are highly promoted for their high rate of energy efficiency (> 90%) and combined with district heating network are a pillar of the EU energy strategy.To un-tap such unexploited reserve of flexibility, and to further enhance turn-down ratio and power ramp capabilities of power oriented CCs, this project proposes the demonstration of an innovative concept based on the coupling of a fast-cycling highly efficient heat pump (HP) with CCs. The integrated system features thermal storage and advanced control concept for smart scheduling. The HP will include an innovative expander to increase the overall efficiency of the HP. In such an integrated concept, the following advantages are obtained: - the HP is controlled to modulate power in order to cope with the CC primary reserve market constraints;- the high temperature heat can be exploited in the district heating network, when available; low temperature cooling power can be used for gas turbine inlet cooling or for steam condenser cooling, thus reducing the water consumption;- in both options, the original CC operational envelope is significantly expanded and additional power flexibility is achieved.In general, the CC integration with a HP and a cold/hot thermal storage brings to a reduction of the Minimum Environmental Load (MEL) and to an increase in power ramp rates, while enabling power augmentation at full load and increasing electrical grid resilience and flexibility.",2017-09-01,2021-12-31,52.0,SIGNED,5904426.25,5904426.25,['energy'],['energy'],"['smart', 'district']",2

We have developed a new technology, called Waterjade, capable of predicting water resources at high resolution, both in terms of snow and river discharge. Differently from other competitive technologies, it adopts a physically based modeling approach that integrates multiple sources of data, like in-situ stations, numerical weather predictions and satellite data. The advantages are increased accuracy and scalability to ungauged basins. Our customers are hydropower companies, whom we deliver a service of snow monitoring upstream the production plants, so they can quantify the energy that is likely to be produced in the long run, and a service of short-term inflow predictions to the plants, useful for safety reason and to optimize the energy production. We are extending the service of snow monitoring also to the public sector, that use it for safety reasons (avalanches) and as an index to anticipate drought.Working with public and private sectors is giving positive feedback, both in terms of credibility and accuracy as we can benefit from the capillary distribution of in-situ stations from public agencies.The business model is a """"subscription-based Service"""" to the Waterjade portal and the market potential is estimated in about 500 M€/y worldwide, with great potential in particular for hydropower, Europe's and world’s largest renewable energy resource.""",2019-06-01,2019-11-30,6.0,SIGNED,50000.0,71429.0,['energy'],,"['positive', 'climate']",2

Efficient new renewable energy solutions are needed in order to maximise world-wide electricity production, whilst meeting climate targets. In Europe alone, more than 26,400 suitable locations for mini (<1MW) hydropower generation remain unexploited, partly due to poor accessibility or unsuitability of existing mini-hydropower solutions. HYDROGO, our mobile, small, easy- and fast-to-install hydropower solution, is designed to alleviate the electricity needs of individuals or communities by producing electricity from river currents and waterfalls, efficiently, and in locations where existing solutions cannot. We have developed two models based on the same technology: Euro-pallet mounted Drop&Go and container-based Plug&Go to meet micro (<100 kW) and mini (<1MW) electricity demands, respectively. The HYDROGO plants can produce current effects up to 600 kW, meaning that Plug&Go could power up to 1,350 households/year. Practical and theoretical testing at the The Norwegian University of Science and Technology has allowed us to develop a HYDROGO prototype, which produces at least 20% more energy per waterfall height than existing hydropower technologies. HYDROGO requires only anchoring but no building work for its installation and is highly customisable to user needs, can be easily relocated, and set-up as a hybrid power station as well as connected to the grid. HYDROGO is not immersed in streams and therefore undisruptive to the environment, easy to maintain and move, if needed. Amongst its many potential applications, HYDROGO is the perfect solution for difficult to access areas and disaster zones where off-grid power is needed immediately.

The principal objective of the SHAR-Q is to optimize the storage capacities deployed in the grid with the help of a peer-to-peer interoperability network that connects neighbourhooding RES+Storage ecosystems into a collaboration framework. Thus, the optimization of storage capacities can be achieved through their sharing among the participating actors. To get connected to the SHAR-Q network, an open interoperability gateway with semantic interface descriptors will be provided that will be based on the most adopted standards in the field. Moreover, the users will be provided with an ability to manage their contribution to the collaborative models on their own in a way that resembles the well-known social web portals (e.g. users can control with whom they wish to share specific storage capacities).

Buildings are responsible of 28% of all CO2 emissions with space heating accounting 65% of all energy consumed. The need for reducing heat leaking through a better insulation of constructions is a key strategy to reduce the CO2 emissions responsible of the Climate Change. On the other hand, the rationalization on the consumption fossil resources through the use of renewable and biobased raw materials is of a strong interest for customers and end-users in construction market. In addition to the thermal performance and sustainability, insulating materials must demonstrate a safe use, especially when a fire takes place.Polyurethane foams (PUR) are the most efficient insulating materials used in construction. However, the main critical problem for them to become the preferred insulation material is a dangerous behavior when exposed to flames due to their high flammability and fast fire propagation, as well as the high amount of extremely toxic fumes released by PUR materials hen burning.To address these challenges, INDRESMAT has developed SAFE-PUR, a new top class of biobased PUR insulating foams that solve the main critical problems related with the lack of passive fire safety of conventional PUR foams. SAFE-PUR foams offer the following results: 1) improve the Thermal Insulation in buildings 15-20 %, 2) increase the Passive Fire Protection 70-80% and 3) reduce the C-footprint 60-70% of insulation materials compared to conventional of PUR foams.

It provides important theoretical insights by disentangling and interrelating the different conceptualizations and measurements of familiarity. The project’s key methodological advancement is the unique combination of three different sensors to behaviourally assess familiarity during in-situ travel and spatial learning: Mobile eye tracking, high precision GNSS positioning, and head/body-worn Inertial Measurement Unit (e.g. providing acceleration data etc.) sensors are fused to study familiarity behaviourally in-situ. Machine learning and deep learning experiments on the behavioural data, singly and in combination, will be used to classify different levels of familiarity reflected in participants’ activities. The outcomes of this investigation form a basis for future research studies on how smart cities can adapt to its citizens' needs, based on their current state of spatial cognition – for which familiarity is a key example.

The future carbon-free energy infrastructure is supposed to consist of a combination of distributed energy renewable resources and energy efficient energy consumption. This challenge can be dealt by improving the efficiency of future sustainable energy systems by applying nanotechnology, advanced materials and advanced manufacturing to efficient energy use. In this context, the quality of Vacuum Insulation Panels has room for important improvements, the most relevant of which is the need to upgrade quality control and monitoring systems of the panels. The nowadays crucial point of the VIPs is the assessment of the insulation performances after the production process (to long procedure) and through their lifetime (today still not possible). Only the control of the manufactured panel and the possibility to regularly monitor installed VIPs, precisely and quickly, allows a constant high rate of energy efficiency and therefore an optimal operation of insulation panels. We have ideated and developed a solution deployable in all the types of VIPs, where insulation performances are measured  instantaneously and in a non-invasive manner. The method is based on quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), which allows to detect the mass variation per unit area by measuring the change in frequency of a Quartz Crystal resonator. The device allows the measurement of panel during the production and after being installed (today not possible) in less than one second.

From these proportions, air conditioning represents 17% of the total electricity consumption in the EU27 residential buildings. In the EU tertiary sector the electric space and water heating system represent 19.22%, the ventilation 12.47%, the commercial refrigeration 8.57% and the air conditioning 2.86% of the buildings electricity consumption. Heating, ventilation and air conditioning system’s electricity consumption of a building can represent between the 30% and 40% of the total energy consumption.The inertia of these power to heat solutions constitute an enormous potential for electric flexibility usable for absorbing the excess of renewable generation and avoiding curtailment while managing local power congestion, voltage stability in the grid and avoiding reversal power flows, as well as minimizing RES production imbalance. That is, DER with thermal inertia can provide services to RES owners, grid operators, aggregators and actors on the power market, while saving energy in the buildings. In fact, flexibility harnessing using heat to power solutions enables to deploy large-scale renewable throughout Europe successfully.The Flexible Heat and Power (FHP) project will develop a Power-to-Heat (and Cooling) solution package that manages this complexity through an easily accessible interface aimed at buildings and power grid actors. A practical prototype will be developed and deployed in two different demonstration scenarios in The Netherlands and Sweden representing diverse parts of the European power grid.

Controlling the spatial extent of solid-state reactions at the nanoscale will enable development of materials, programmed on an atomic level, which will facilitate many emerging applications like bioinspired smart batteries and artificial synapses for future neuromorphic electronics. However, currently, there are no chemistry methods which allow precise spatial control at the nanoscale, limiting progress towards the programmable matter.   Here I propose a completely new way to create novel materials using two-dimensional (2D) chemical reactions at the atomically-defined interfaces between crystalline solids. Usually, reactions between macroscopic solids are hindered as their large dimensions prevent placing them close enough to each other to support chemical transformations. Thus, just a few years ago, the task of placing two atomically flat crystals within angstrom proximity of each other, to initiate chemical interactions between them, was impossible to realise. This situation has changed dramatically with the advent of van der Waals technology - disassembly of various layered crystals into individual atom- or molecule-thick layers followed by a highly-controlled reassembly of these layers into artificial heterostructures. Building on our recent progress in van der Waals technology, I aim to realise interplanar chemical reactions between highly-crystalline solids in precisely controllable conditions using temperature, electric and magnetic fields, light, sound, pressure, and mechanical forces as means of control.

Increased penetration of the intermittent and uncertain renewable energy sources effectively implies additional load and generation flexibility is required at multiple time-scales to ensure safe and stable operation of the electric grid. Since conventional generation is increasingly displaced by renewables, this additional flexibility can no longer be sourced solely from conventional plants. According to the International Energy Agency, buildings are responsible for about 40% of the global energy consumption, and about 50% of the energy used in a building is accounted for by the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system. Thus, improving operational efficiency of HVAC systems will results in large savings in the energy consumption. Moreover, buildings present a unique opportunity as flexible loads that can be controlled to provide ancillary services to the electric power grid, and thus enable high penetration of renewables.  High thermal capacity of large commercial buildings allow real-time control of their HVAC systems to regulate electricity demand as required for grid stability, without effecting the quality of service in the building significantly.In this project, our objective is to develop (1) novel scalable optimal control algorithms that reduce building peak load and energy consumption, (2) a distributed control framework for coordinating multiple buildings as flexible energy resources for ancillary services, and (3) tools for assessing the performance of this framework from economic, environmental and sustainability perspectives.",2016-06-01,2018-05-31,24.0,SIGNED,157845.6,157845.6,['energy'],,"['energy consumption', 'buildings', 'building']",3

These trends are on an ascending trajectory - e.g. the average energy demand for air-conditioning has been growing by ~17% per year in the EU. Counterbalancing actions are urgently required to reverse them.The objective of this proposal is to develop intelligent window insulation technologies from sustainable materials. The developed technologies will adjust the amount of radiation escaping or entering a window depending upon the ambient environmental conditions and will be capable of delivering unprecedented reductions to the energy needed for regulating the temperature in commercial and residential buildings. Recognising the distinct requirements between newly built and existing infrastructure, two parallel concepts will be developed: i) A new class of intelligent glazing for new window installations, and, ii) a flexible, intelligent, polymer film to retrofit existing window installations. Both solutions will be enhanced with unique self-cleaning properties, bringing about additional economic benefits through a substantial reduction in maintenance costs.Overall, we aim to develop intelligent glazing technologies that combine: i) power savings of >250 W/m2 of glazing capable of delivering >25% of energy savings and efficiency improvements >50% compared with existing static solutions; ii) visible transparency of >60% to comply with the EU standards for windows ,and, iii) self-cleaning properties that introduce a cost balance.

IntelHeat will satisfy customers’ needs to optimize heating regimes, will automate the process and will  provide effective savings of electricity.  That also means less influence to climate via  decreased carbon footprints of  the systems. The core of IntelHeat is a proprietary innovative optical precipitation sensor for real-time monitoring of snowing both in the atmosphere and remotely near the point. This unique feature accounts possible clogging of the point by blizzard from a passing train. The principle is based on multi-channel acquisition using a combination of diffuse and direct reflection of infrared light from the precipitation particles. Algorithms for electrical heating use inputs of a set of real-time meteorological data from the sensor to manage the regime flexibly. Functional prototypes were built and pass trial exploitation on the Latvian Railways. First positive conclusions about adequacy of detection, reliability of work and savings of energy (up to 80% in critical periods and 50% in average) were obtained. The end-users are national and EU railway companies. The potential market is estimated from initial implementation in Latvia as 800 pieces of precipitation sensor installed at points and 220 IntelHeat systems for heating control cabinets. In Europe: up to 20,000 sensors and 5,000 systems. Globally: up to 50,000 and 15,000 pieces accordingly.

The maintenance of optimal temperatures and optimal light incidence is critical for high crop yields. In summer, GHs are typically white washed or shaded by nets or by screens, in order to avoid excess temperature in the GH. Standing out, this sunlight surplus can be turned into electricity by adding PV panels, which can supply electricity to the national grid and/or supply the required energy for a heating/cooling system for the optimal control of the GH micro-climate. However, previous attempts of dual harvesting, which have been performed mainly in Italy and Spain, used conventional PV panels or semi transparent PV panels that were positioned to receive maximum sunlight on the south facing roof of GHs and significantly shaded crops all year around, resulting in a significant a negative effect, not only with regards to high crop yields loss, up to 25% but also to negative effects on edibles and fruit size, hardness and colour, which reduce sell prices of affected crops.On the other hand, If PV panels would have been placed in other positioning then, PV harvesting would underperform and consequently PV yields would be reduced. SUN4GREEN new smart design directs light either into the greenhouse or to the PV panels depending on the season need.What makes SUN4GREEN different and revolutionary is that its performance is season dependant and is adapted to GH characteristics. Its design allows growers having real dual sun and crop harvesting targeted to obtain benefits from both sources, which is not possible with simple, direct PV technology implementation, not adaptable to seasonal agriculture requirements and where thus, agriculture was compromised to make room for PV electricity production.

Current levels of usage and disposal generate several environmental problems with 74% of post-consumer plastic waste in Europe either incinerated or landfilled. Recent packaging directives from the EC have led to the imposition of challenging targets for recycling, and national governments are also examining new ways to discourage packaging waste. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is very recyclable and offers an opportunity to effectively and efficiently recapture and reuse the energy and resources of its raw materials. However, the high energy demand of current recycling processes renders it expensive and non-viable, making recycled PET (rPET) more expensive than virgin PET, resulting in low uptake in the lucrative food and beverages packaging industry. The main technical problem with current recycling is the high amount of energy consumed in the processes which limits the industrial profitability. Furthermore, existing technologies require additional purification systems to eliminate contaminates, further increasing cost and limiting supply. Gamma Meccanica is developing an alternative recycling process, using microwaves, to solve the current viability problems. Our technology will be the first in the world to address the profitability of the microwave technology in PET recycling by: Reducing the energy consumption of the process by up to 50%; Decontaminating the pellets in a single step process, providing a cleaning efficiency of >97% to attain pellet purity levels required by the FDA and EFSA; Reduced GHG emissions – saving about 2 tonnes of GHG for each tonne of rPET; Enabling rPET to be sold at a 15% cheaper price than virgin PET.

While genomic research is paving the way for significant advances in healthcare, its practice has led to new challenges for biotechnology firms in terms of increasing data volume, variety and complexity. Given that the data representing a single human genome takes up to 100 gigabytes of storage space, biotech companies engaged in genomic research must develop the computing infrastructure and skills to manage, store, analyse and interpret massive quantities of highly complex data. Healthcare centres, in particular, need a data storage solution that uses low power, small space, small volume, low weight, and is quiet, and easy to implement. It is quite a challenge for an inner-city hospital to construct and operate a data centre like those built by Google, Amazon, & Microsoft. Current alternatives are either too costly, or exhibit low reliability and/or performance, and none of them achieve the right level of security. In answer to this need, Swiss Vault is developing a high-density, modular genome sequencing/storage proprietary system, which enables organisations to scale their data capabilities in terms of both computing power and storage with high security and low carbon footprint. The BasePort project will allow us to bring to market a data storage hardware integrated with software that operates with 1/10th power consumption, 1/4th volume, and 1/5th weight of conventional comparable systems. The innovative form-factor is 10X more power- & 20X more space-efficient, easy to manage, ideal for Industry 4.0, Smart Cities and Edge computing. Our platform makes data storage a “Green Technology” and enables organizations to reduce their data storage costs and their data-carbon footprint by up to 10-fold.

The IEA-Morocco work programme will include capacity building and training in data and statistics; modelling and support for the de-carbonisation programme. The IEA will also provide advice on further energy price liberalisation and energy security in the oil, gas and electricity sectors. It will also advise the Moroccan Ministry of Energy, Mines and Sustainable Development (MEMDD) and related stakeholders on optimal technologies and best practices that can be implemented to help Morocco attain its Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy targets. It is anticipated that EU support will cover the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy work streams outlined in the JWP. In addition to on-site visits, IEA experts will host interactive webinars in English with Moroccan energy efficiency stakeholders on mutually agreed priority areas. The IEA could also assist MEMDD and the Moroccan Agency for Energy Efficiency (AMEE) in assessing the economic and other conditions for a push towards clean, electric cooking. The main purpose of this activity would be to ensure that energy efficiency measures are accelerated and run parallel with renewable energy deployment.This proposal relates to item 57 in the Horizon 2020 Work Programme for 2016-2017.

Although in principle a PED approach seems a solid and ambitious strategy, this should be complemented with long term urban planning to ensure upscaling and fostering higher impacts. Currently city energy plans are starting to be designed with a 2030 horizon, according to the standard city commitments, as for instance those reflected in the SECAPs and other more specific city plans.  Project will address methodologies to support cities in their long term urban planning towards an adequate energy transition, paving the way of the planning, implementation and up-scaling process.

The absence of SPREM is a major barrier for large scale sustainable energy investments in public buildings in the short, medium and long term in Flanders. This barrier has consistently been identified by SURE2050 consortium partners supporting public clients with energy efficiency services as well as by municipalities themselves, including the more than 95 municipalities that indicated their strong interest in SURE2050 via a Letter of Support.  SURE2050 will remove this barrier by providing SPREM-training, SPREM tools and coaching to municipalities and to regional governmental organisations in Flanders. SPREM will generate critical information for strategic decision making, such as reliable quantitative and qualitative data on buildings, energy renovation potential and the use of resources. Thanks to the long-term SPREM vision, shorter term energy efficiency investments can be made without causing any lock-in effect for the future. A broad consortium of public and private partners has been created to maximise the involvement of these public organisations in the programme and to support them with the implementation of SPREM in their organisation, as well as with the concrete sustainable investment projects with a minimum value of 20 million EUR.As the absence of SPREM is not limited to public organisations in Flanders, the SURE2050 proposed project will also have a high added value for most public entities in Europe.

Our vision for the future cities: everybuilding processing its own organic waste while recapturing the energy, fertiliser and water from it. The food supply chain produces alot of organic waste material that needs managing. Traditional ways of dealing with this waste are not sustainable. Urbanisation and the increasing pressure on landfill sites is driving up the cost of waste management. Hauling this waste from the point of production to centralised facilities adds cost and increases the carbon footprint of waste. The patented and multi-award winning FLEXIBUSTER™ is designed to turn food waste into energy right at the point where the waste is generated and the energy required. Once installed, FLEXIBUSTER™ can process between 500-3000 kg of waste per day, reducing the cost of waste transport and disposal, whilst generating clean energy in form of electricity and heat, with nutrient rich water and fertiliser as sole by-products. This is done in a containerised, modular set-up that is easily scalable within site and geographically as well and is fully automated, can be remotely controlled. Our solution has the highest fit to Future City concept on the market, as can be integrated into building infrastructure and has unique odour control. We designed and are pilot testing our TRL6 system currently. The full system architecture and functioning is patented in our target geographies.

When inversion symmetry is broken as in ferroelectrics or at surfaces or interfaces, oxides can thus harbour large electric fields. This unleashes a quantum phenomenon known as the Rashba spin-orbit coupling that allows the generation of spin currents from charge currents and vice versa without ferromagnets, circumventing their drawbacks to perform these tasks. In the FRESCO project, we will combine the advantages of Rashba-driven spin-orbitronics phenomena with the ultralow switching energy of ferroelectrics. Building upon our demonstrations of giant spin-charge conversion at polar oxide interfaces and of non-volatile electoresistance in ferroelectric tunnel junctions, we will aim at a non-volatile electrical control of interconverted spin and charge currents in materials systems combining Rashba spin-orbit coupling with ferroelectricity. Guided by first-principles calculations, we will design and explore several families of atomically engineered polar heterostructures combining oxides and transition metal compounds. We will assess their spin-charge interconversion efficiency, its controllability by electric fields and its connection with the energy dependent spin Berry curvature. We will harness this controllability in spin-based non-volatile logic architectures operating through ferroelectricity-controlled spin-charge conversion. Building upon this, we will propose and explore several classes of devices including light-activated sources of spin currents based on photoferroelectricity, reconfigurable non-volatile logic gates, and tuneable THz sources and modulators.

Our concept comes from the integration of Microbial Electrochemical Technologies (MET) with the biofilters used in constructed wetlands. iMETland outperforms classical biofilters from constructed wetlands by using electroactive bacteria in combination with a innovative electroconductive material to achive depuration rates that are 10-fold higher than classical techniques. On top of that, the low biomass yield generated under electrogenic conditions avoids any bed colmatation. Wastewater will be also converted into pathogen-free water suitable for irrigation by using an electro-oxidative methodology. Furthermore, the unique conversion of sewage treatment into electric current by electricity-producing bacteria makes such a process an internal reporter of the biological depuration process. So thus, it can be used as output signal to control the process and can easily inform the operator through ICT tools, converting the depuration in an interactive process between device and a smart-phone in end-user´s hands.iMETland try to fill the gap that was sharply identified by the programme topic: WATER-1-2014/2015: Bridging the gap: from innovative water solutions to market replication.

The spread of electronic systems in remote locations should thus be accompanied by a change in power generation, making use of dislocated and disordered energy sources. A cost-efficient and environmentally friendly realization of energy harvesting (EH), however, is still a challenge, as the required input of functional material and electronic components in comparison to the energy output is high and often involves lead-based materials, manufacturing methods that consume high amounts of energy and costly assembly steps.SYMPHONY aims for the development of new materials for low-cost and scalable printing and structuring processes to fabricate multimodal EH solutions based on the ferroelectric polymer P(VDF-TrFE) as well as printed energy storage devices and rectifiers not using rare elements and heavy metals. The hybrid integration of these devices on flexible films with low power harvesting ICs will result in a specific cost below 1€/mW (well below the value for piezoceramic and electrodynamic EH).

Accounting for 50% of the EU's annual energy consumption, heating and cooling is the sector with the biggest energy-saving potential in Europe, and urgently needs to become more sustainable. In the low temperature range (5 to +100°C), most thermal energy amounts are required and then discarded worldwide. PCM are key materials to save these huge energy and – at the same time – CO2 amounts. They can run through a reproducible phase-change at a substance-specific temperature, during which the thermal energy is either stored in very large amounts or returned at a constant temperature. Since decades, an adequate method is being sought to transfer PCM into a user-friendly form. Both existing micro- and macro-encapsulation solutions for PCM storage have until now revealed industrially, technically and economically inappropriate.

A poor electricity saving behaviour and the lack of awareness of our consuming practices’ impact on environment can increase household electricity consumption by up to 15%. EcoFeel is a smart energy advisor taking advantage of power and spectrum analysis in order not only to detect connected appliances through variations in current and voltage but also recognising their noise in the electrical network. This results in a deep monitoring of household’s electricity consumption making people more aware of their environmental impact. Ecoisme wants to optimise EcoFeel design to increase its performance in detecting appliances and monitoring household electricity consumption; In addition a more user friendly interface is forecasted. Large pilot testing of Ecoisme solution with support of stakeholders in the field of telecommunication and energy utilities will serve to demonstrate the reliability of the solution. global Energy Management System market, valued at €21 billion in 2015, and expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.3% – to reach €64.1 billion in 2022.

The number of households is significantly less in the US with 117 million properties. This means an equivalent number of owners or tenants potentially interested in making their homes more energy efficient with a direct impact on environment. EcoFeel will contribute to the mitigation of global climate and energy challenges because it reduces household energy consumption and can minimise the impact on the environment accounting on human behaviour.

EMB3Rs’ final users will employ the platform to determine the costs and benefits related with excess HC utilization routes, and to define the required implementation conditions for the most promising solutions. The platform will allow industrial users and other relevant stakeholders to autonomously and intuitively explore and assess the feasibility of new technology and business scenarios. This will benefit each individual producer/ consumer in a given industrial community but also enable win-win solutions between industries and final HC users in other sectors. The main aim is to reuse and/or trade excess thermal energy in a holistic perspective within an industrial process HC/energy system environment or framed in an HC network in regulated or liberalized markets. The resource and energy intensive industries (REII) and DHC networks will be able to use and rely on the EMB3Rs platform to investigate the revenue potential of using industrial excess HC as an energy (re)source. The REII will be able to evaluate the benefits of investing in low carbon options, such as the integration of renewable HC technologies and thermal storage, in industrial processes. Ultimately, by translating industrial excess HC into savings, revenues and increased overall system efficiency, EMB3Rs will allow the REII community to improve its competitiveness, foster and accelerate the decarbonisation of the HC market overall and contribute to the EU climate change mitigation goals.

Using comparative case studies and coordinated cross-country experiments, we explore if and how these instruments can be generalized, transferred, or scaled up to new socio-cultural, economic, or institutional conditions to unleash their innovative power. Based on this unique data set, we will develop two new transformative frameworks – “situated co-creation” and “socially robust scaling” – to guide the wider dissemination of co-creation. We will synthesize our findings into an “EU Policy Roadmap” to support ongoing EU innovation policy efforts. Empirically, SCALINGS is closely integrated with over two dozen European co-creation initiatives that deal with cross-cultural transferability on a daily basis.

The GELCLAD is produced using a single co-extrusion procedure in which both ecoWPC framing skin and FEA core are simultaneously formed such that no discontinuity is formed between them. Using a multilayer effective continuous extrusion allows the benefits of high quality multi-meso-structured systems and productive production to be obtained without the traditional drawbacks of existing bonding lamination of extremely high embodied energy insulation materials, and high labouring and skilled installation of multi material layers.

Currently, the primary source of energy is fossil fuel, but in view of undeniable climate warming, an alternative fuel is dearly wanted. Metal powders are a tantalizing, totally carbon-free and recyclable option for such a fuel. Its combustion products are solid metal-oxide particles, which, after capture, can be recycled to metal powders again using green electricity. The technology required to burn metal powder aerosols in a stable and reliable way is, however, still in its infancy. Rapid growth of the technology is unlikely, because fundamental understanding of combustion of dense metal aerosols is largely lacking. Herein lies a virgin field of fundamental research, with huge potential for practical application. Fundamental principles behind metal fuel flames are addressed in this proposal, in a step-wise, combined experimental & theoretical/numerical approach. On single-particle level, I will unravel the influence of mutual interactions. Their consecutive ignition will create combustion wave fronts traveling through metal aerosols. Such planar flame fronts will be created in the lab as well as studied numerically and subsequently used as building block for modeling 3D flames. Finally, Bunsen-type burners will be developed to characterize turbulent, 3D flames. Detailed experiments using microscopy for metal-(oxide) particle composition as well as new optical diagnostic techniques on dedicated, lab-scale metal aerosol burners will serve as benchmarks for validation of models.

Furthermore, accurate vibro-acoustic modelling across the entire building acoustics frequency range presently requires a huge computational effort. As a result, the acoustic development of building systems is usually based on general design rules, insufficiently accurate prediction models and many experimental prototype tests. Such development is costly and time consuming, and leads to suboptimal designs. This project therefore aims to develop an efficient yet sufficiently accurate prediction framework for the acoustic design of building systems which takes all uncertainties into account and which opens the way for design optimization. Four fundamental breakthroughs are required. First, a new approach to high-frequency subsystem modelling will overcome the limitations of the current statistical energy analysis paradigm and handle a high degree of geometric and material complexity. Second, a modelling framework for built-up systems will be developed, which incorporates different component model types and which switches between them as the frequency increases. The third development consists of quantifying the combined effect of all uncertain parameters on the overall sound insulation performance in a logically consistent and computationally efficient way. Finally, a robust optimization approach that spans the entire building acoustics frequency range and that accounts for all relevant non-acoustic performance criteria as well will be developed. Each development will be complemented by showcase applications in building acoustics, yet the fundamental nature of the developments make that they will have a profound impact in all disciplines where the study and/or control of mechanical wave propagation are important.",2017-08-01,2023-01-31,66.0,SIGNED,1386875.0,1386875.0,['energy'],,"['building', 'buildings']",2

These pollutants come from urbanization, industrialization, unsustainable food production practices, and poor water and wastewater management strategies . Waste Water Treatment Plants (WWTPs) are one of the most expensive public industries due to exceptionally high energy consumption. Although the EU has made waste water treatment obligatory for cities and towns within the EU-27 (Water Framework Directive (WFD) 91/271/CEE), little has been done to tackle the unsustainable 15,021 GWh of energy these plants consume per year.The ACT aeration system utilises less energy than any known aeration technology. ACT's technology utilises new methods based on hydrodynamic supercavitation to efficiently mix gas (air containing oxygen) and liquid (treated wastewater). This new technology is versatile and can be adapted to meet the aeration needs of almost any type of WWTP. ACT has established a process which uses the potential energy of a liquid flow to induce a vaporous cavity (super cavity), to aspirate atmospheric air and efficiently mix it with treated wastewater. ACT aeration devices (aerators) are arranged in the manner which allows for several aerators to operate under a single simple pump. Additionally, due to the nature of the hydrodynamic process there is little equipment depreciation because the imploding vapours bubbles do not have direct contact with the solid surface of the equipment. ACT's aeration process does not require air blowers/compressors, air distribution piping, diffusers installation construction and pipes, which dramatically reduces the cost of an aeration system by a factor of 3-5 times.The users/clients of the Cavitech system are the over 71,000 WWTP that are currently operational in the EU member states.",2018-08-01,2018-11-30,4.0,CLOSED,50000.0,71429.0,['energy'],['energy'],"['energy consumption', 'cities']",2

This is the case of many EU States. Because of issues related to decreasing ore grades and scarcity of supply of primary metal forms, recycling of above-ground deposits of metal-bearing waste (or “in-use stock”) will become an increasingly important means of securing resources to provide essential building blocks to the European industry. Recycling of metal in-use stock has the further potential of avoiding consuming the large amounts of energy required in primary metal production, and of reducing related greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, however, because of metal losses during and after use, end-of-life recycling rates for many metals are often very low, so the potential for improving those recycling efficiencies is an important consideration for the achievement of a more resource efficient economy and sustainable development in Europe. This project proposes a comprehensive, exemplary research line that merges complementary drivers in the assessment of the metal-energy-climate change nexus for (i) estimating the size of current urban mines for selected, critical metals; (ii) assessing future opportunities and barriers to their recycling, and (iii) related potentials for carbon emissions reduction.

The numbers demonstrate that we are wasting our natural capital at an accelerating pace. The time to act is now, by initiating large scale land restoration programs involving tree plantings. The ecosystem restoration market is globally estimated at US $300 billion. Towards this goal we have developed a unique, fully functional product (TRL 7), called ‘Cocoon’, to promote tree establishment in dryland environments. Acting as a tree incubator the Cocoon nourishes tree seedlings, resulting in high survival rates and increased resilience to adverse growing conditions, while maintaining water efficiency. The scope of this FTI is to prototype an innovative manufacturing line in the EU with the following objectives:1. Reach a production capacity of 1 million Cocoons per year2. Achieve a production output of 125 units per hour (as compared to 40 units in status quo)3. Reduce the manufacturing costs per Cocoon from €5 (currently) to €1 (target costs)4. Reduce energy consumption by 50% & manufacture with 100% recycled energy from waste heat, solar heat and PV5. Integrate local agriculture waste materials or grasses in the product When production cost can go down to €1, completely new, large-scale markets will open up. Our project will stimulate private sector investment in land regeneration projects and promote trans-disciplinary research & innovation (industrial design, organic waste recycling, biomass, renewable energy).

Energy, in particular electricity, is also a valuable resource. Its rational use saves not only money but also resources and helps to reduce CO2 emissions. Through the prohibition of the dumping of untreated sewage sludge and discussions on limitations of its agricultural exploitation, many wastewater treatment plant operators, wastewater associations and disposers must develop and implement new concepts for the treatment of sewage sludge.It is therefore obvious to try to use sewage sludge as a fuel for energy production. Solutions have already been developed for larger communities. Smaller, especially rural municipalities still spend the sewage sludge remains on agricultural land because technologies for energy recovery from sewage sludge are so far not available in matching orders of magnitude up to 1 MW of thermal power capacity.The project aims at developing a marketable technology within 24 months consisting of a smart “in-cycle” system for energy-efficient, low-cost, low-carbon generation of electricity from the non-fossil fuel: pasty sewage sludge in the range 400 kW to 1 MW thermal capacity. The scale of the proposed technology should correspond to the throughput data of the upstream system, avoiding all concerns of logistic, transport, collecting, storage, deposing, pre-treatment of the sewage sludge; (a typical input from 480 to 1000 kWth is considered).Additionally, this proposed process should represent an affordable alternative to conventional routes of sewage sludge treatment, with their high release of GHG-emissions and a significant contribution to reduce GHG-emission of the necessary disposal service.

7038,THEcore,"Thermally efficient, cost-reduced nanostructured foams for vacuum insulation panels",748256,"Climate change is an energy problem, says the conclusion of studies related to global warming. Aware of this “inconvenient truth”, Europe launched strategies, with precise energy savings and gas emissions reductions, to be reached by 2020 and an ultimate sustainable energy system by 2050. As a large share of energy consumption is spent by the household sector (heating, air conditioning, refrigeration), advanced thermal insulation products give a crucial contribution to better energy efficiency.Vacuum Insulation Panels (VIPs) are currently the most effective solution. By offering ten times higher thermal insulation than traditional materials of the same thickness, VIPs use less material, thus saving usable spaces. Besides the high insulation capacity, volume reduction by the use of VIPs eases waste disposal, lowers extra logistic costs and transport emissions while reducing the energy needed to keep the temperature at a desired level. On the other hand, high performance VIPs are still unaffordable for the majority of customers mainly due to the costly fumed silica core (~50% of the VIP cost). The search for cost-effective core materials is a challenge for the scientific community but, revolutionary and cheap nanostructured polystyrene foam (SUMFOAM), recently developed by Sumteq GmbH, may fill this gap in VIP technology. This project focuses on the unique combination of SUMFOAM with VIP. The vast experience in VIP technology by va-Q-tec will be fundamental to achieve higher thermal efficiency at much lower production costs than previously reached. Also, SUMFOAM offers the possibility of accurately shaping and tailoring solutions for the intended application. In addition to setting a new figure-of-merit in VIP, the ultimate goal of the project is to contribute to the EU strategy of reducing energy impact by establishing advanced, application-tailored VIP products with a higher thermal efficiency and a reduced weight at an affordable price compared to existing VIPs.",2017-06-01,2019-05-31,24.0,CLOSED,159460.8,159460.8,['energy'],,"['energy consumption', 'climate', 'community']",3

Smart cities, medical devices, financial transactions, self-driving cars, all rely on electronics. At the same time, these activities generate huge amounts of data, which for privacy and security reasons, are stored encrypted on a possibly untrusted cloud server. Yet, many applications benefit from operations on this data. Statistics or machine learning on medical, financial, automotive or energy data could discover trends or abuse, could be used to monitor pandemics, to tune supply and demand, and much more. Ideally, the calculations on the data should be done without decrypting them first to avoid data leaks.  Computing on encrypted data is the new magic in the field of cryptography: it enables calculations on the encrypted data, while data remains encrypted in the cloud and without the need to decrypt it. The result will only be decrypted by the final recipient. Challenging in these novel mathematical concepts is a gigantic blow-up in the size of ciphertext data, in the amount of calculations on the encrypted data, and in the novel lattice based arithmetic used. The core challenge addressed in BELFORT is to make this new technology feasible from a hardware perspective and in realistic scenarios, providing the best performance/energy balance, for it to run on cloud servers and edge devices, within reasonable memory, computation and energy budgets. We propose reconfigurable hardware-based acceleration with domain-specific programmable co-processors, which combine energy efficiency with domain specific programmability and with resistance to attacks from classic and quantum computers. We will develop multiple new ideas as well as bring them together in an end-to-end demonstrator.

Then, research and innovation actions in this topic are focused on finding new technical solution, developing emerging technologies and improving heat transfer efficiency of existing systems. There is required, on the one hand, a better knowledge of the thermal properties of the ground and, on the other, the efficient implementation of thermal energy transfer technologies.ITER Project (Improving Thermal Efficiency of horizontal ground heat exchangers) totally agree with these purposes. In fact, the overall aim of ITER is to ensure the sustainability of ground coupled heating-cooling systems and especially the horizontal ground heat exchangers systems. Key challenges are (i) to enhance the heat transfer of the ground surrounding the pipes creating thermally enhanced backfilling material (TEBM) suitable for horizontal systems; (ii) to assess the performance and the environmental impacts of new promising technological solutions as helix systems with and without TEBM; (iii) to monitor the results over time through direct measurements and numerical simulation.Thermal laboratory measurements and in situ monitoring of existing and duly installed horizontal systems will be provided by close cooperation between host institutions and non-academic partners.

These ligno-cellulosic materials originated from rural locations will be upgraded and densified into uniform sizes at source, allowing cost-effective transportation to existing industrial sites. The core enabling technology is superheated steam processing (SHS). SHS has been implemented in diverse drying applications at industrial scales, due to its superior heat transfer properties. At pilot scales, SHS has been proven to torrefy biomass at temperatures up to 300°C with minimal ligno-cellulose breakdown. Unlike conventional torrefaction techniques, which use flue gases as heating medium, it does not contaminate the torrefied biomass and volatile fractions, allowing economic recovery of chemicals. Moreover, it is also readily scalable for continuous operation. In SteamBio, a transportable demonstrator unit will be operated at five different rural locations where it will be used to torrefy tonnage quantities of six different agro-forestry residues at a throughput of 500 kg/h. The demonstrator unit will be operated at these rural locations throughout the last twelve months of the project to allow for seasonal fluctuations in the composition of the materials being valorised. The torrefied biomass fractions (solid and liberated volatiles) will then be validated as green building blocks in commercially relevant chemical production and in bioenergy use. Life cycle experts will validate that SteamBio will have positive environmental impacts. A robust business strategy will be developed to enable the results to cross the """"valley of death"""" post-project and to ensure widespread market replication.

Variable renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, as well as increased end-user flexibility and a market-oriented operation of power plants, results in larger fluctuations in the power system. Hydro power, due to its quick response and storage capability represents an important asset for grid balancing. HydroFlex aims to make hydro power available in a time as short as possible by performing well-focused research and innovation actions on the key bottlenecks of hydro power plants that restricts their flexibility. The project will start off by identifying the operating conditions of hydro power plants in the future energy system. Research will be focused on the flexibility of Francis turbines, the most common turbine type in Europe, and the configuration of synchronous generators and frequency converters that allow for variable speed operation. Variable speed operation increases the operating range of the turbines, reduces the fatigue loads, and allow for higher ramping rates and start-stop-cycles reaching up to 30 times per day. HydroFlex also addresses methods to mitigate the negative effects on downstream water courses that may result from higher flexibility of hydro power plants, by developing and testing a technology for active underground storage of water.

The proposed project has been carefully chosen to match the researcher's experience in bio-sources materials with the host scientists’ expertise in low energy building technologies to produce some innovative outcomes and create new benefits to the society in Europe. The project aims to develop an environmentally-friendly bio-sources aerogel as the support core for vacuum insulation panels (BioCore VIP). Thermal insulation is a primary approach to reduce the buildings’ energy demand. Aerogel, particularly encapsulated in vacuum panel with a multilayer film, is a super insulation material with an extremely low thermal conductivity and hence can obtain the required thermal resistance with a very small thickness, which is desirable commercially in order to minimise the effect of insulation on the building usable space. Development of the proposed aerogel requires comprehensive scientific knowledge including material preparation, freeze-drying, heat transfer and buildings’ energy analysis. Combination of the expertise between the Incoming Researcher and the host team matches this requirement perfectly. In addition to the scientific goals, the Incoming Researcher will contribute his expertise on polysaccharide aerogel and soil water retention to provide training for researchers, students and industrial contacts by hosting seminars, giving lectures and participating in outreach activities.",2018-09-01,2020-08-31,24.0,CLOSED,195454.8,195454.8,['energy'],,"['building', 'energy demand', 'buildings']",3

In contrast to the concept of ‘energy’ in sources and systems of fuel and power generation, I understand ‘energies’ as ‘multi-faceted and interrelated phenomena that emit sound and can be listened to in productive ways’. ‘Sonic agency’ is defined as ‘acoustic as well as electronically amplified and transmitted sounds as levers to the senses and creators of potential change’. This anthropological notion of sound encompasses both the sound practices of Indigenous peoples addressing environmental issues as well as urban climate activism and its sound practices across all the sites in which it may be present, such as classical media reports, the a/v in social media, music and street protests, artistic expressions and new techniques and practices. The aim is to unveil the continuities and variations of different forms of ‘sonic agency’. The project is innovative in its understanding of ‘sound’ as an analytical point of access to the complex concept of ‘energies’. It understands sound itself as energies in three ways: (1) Sound waves as mechanical energy, (2) sound practices of urban climate activists as articulations of the so-called ‘energy unconscious’ and (3) as urban examples of the Indigenous’ notion of ‘energy intimacy’. The project will have a synchronic and diachronic perspective, as it also will refer to historic protest movements and the role of ‘sonic agency’ within them. Thus, it aims to provide new insights for enhancing the terminology, methods and theories of Sound Studies and for re-thinking the Western concept of ‘energy’.

Nature offers a chance to off-load heat directly into the cold outer space via the so-called “sky window”: a spectral range from 8 – 13 µm, where our atmosphere is transparent. Concomitantly, solar radiance influx needs to be minimized by scattering and reflection, which would counteract the radiatively removed energy. VISIRday aims to provide ground-breaking new materials and concepts to emit thermal energy directly into this transparent sky window. A radically holistic approach is necessary to understand and design the optical properties of nano- and mesostructured materials over the entire spectral range (300 nm – 20 µm), with the mid-IR sky window being fully emissive, and all other spectral wavelengths being fully reflective. I will therefore combine top-down direct write lithography with intricate bottom-up colloidal self-assembly to device hierarchically structured systems fully addressing these stringent optical properties. A new material class – surface phonon polariton supporting nano- and mesoparticles – with adjustable absorption properties in the mid-IR range, will take a leading role as novel colloidal building block.

Bio-energy is particularly relevant to the Work Programme, because it is at the crossroads of several key European policies – from the Strategic Energy Technology Plan Roadmap on Education and Training (SET-Plan) to the European Bio-economy Strategy for European Food Safety and Nutrition Policy. So far, technological development has concentrated on using crops and wood for fuel, energy and industrial products. These conventional bio-resources are, however, limited, and the use of nonconventional, currently unused or under-utilised bio-resources provides the best possibility for the growth of the bioeconomy. However, European development in this priority field is failing to keep pace with demand due to a lack of qualified personnel, a lack of cohesion and integration among stakeholders, and poorly developed links between professional training and the real needs of industry.

7661,PRD-Trigger,Precipitation triggered rock dynamics: the missing mesoscopic link,850853,"Climate change leads to increasing weathering cycles on landscapes and the built environment. Promotion of alternative energy sources such as geothermal energy intensifies cyclic perturbations of the underground environment. Both lead to precipitation-dissolution cycles of salts, natural constituents of brines present inside porous rock. When precipitation occurs inside the pores, stresses build up which eventually crack the material. This might be a positive outcome, e.g., increasing the production rate of a geothermal reservoir, or on the contrary, be the cause of severe deterioration of natural building stones and coastal erosion.What is the actual trigger for the dynamic response of a rock when precipitation occurs, and can we ultimately control this trigger? The answer lies at the meso-scale, i.e. the scale of the pore network, where precipitation-dissolution reactions, geometry changes and flow and transport properties changes meet. These reactions and changes are strongly coupled, but their respective importance for the resulting rock dynamics is unclear. A combined experimental-modelling approach will be developed, comprising: (1) 4D X-ray micro-tomographic experiments providing new insights in the correlations between transport-precipitation-deformation processes inside rock; (2) a virtual simulator for precipitation-triggered rock dynamics based on a unified phase-field description; (3) a model-based image analysis approach, combining the simulator and the experimental dataset through a Bayesian framework for properties and constitutive model identification and hierarchization. This hierarchization will pinpoint the governing trigger(s). By acting on the trigger, controlled precipitation-induced cracking and crack healing will be demonstrated on core-scale rocks.

NoSoilPV aims to tackle this issue by developing a smart method capable of quantifying the soiling accumulated on the PV modules in real time without the need of expensive additional hardware. Moreover, through the analysis of historical precipitation datasets and the use of weather prediction models, the algorithm developed in this project will predict the economic impact of soiling and notify at which time artificial cleanings should be performed in order to minimize costs and maximize the energy production.NoSoilPV will be conducted by Dr. Leonardo Micheli within the Centre for Advanced Studies in Energy and Environment (CEAEMA) of the University of Jaén (Spain). CEAEMA is an ideal environment for this project, which involves PV performance analysis, weather and dust prediction modelling and machine learning techniques, because of the high quality research conducted in PV and in all the multidisciplinary aspects of the project. NoSoilPV aims to answer a number of unsolved questions in soiling and to provide the community a useful tool to increase the energy production and the economic revenues. The project will support the EU in its effort to increase the clean energy share and to maximize material efficiency, leading to an increase in PV energy yield, without the installation of new modules or systems.

Solar thermal collection and photovoltaics are the dominating technologies, however, the combined photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) technology is expected to become popular due to its higher overall efficiency, more cost effective and better match with building energy demand as well. Integration of radiative cooling into a PV/T collector can further contribute to such merits by adding a night sky cooling function, so a RC-PV/T collector can produce electricity and heat during the daytime and provide cooling during the nighttime. To achieve such triple functions, the applicants have analysed and proposed the ideal spectral selective characteristics of the RC-PV/T panel, and a desirable RC-PV/T micro/nano coating as well as a RC-PV/T collector will be designed and trial-manufactured.The project has been carefully designed to match the Incoming Researcher’s profile with the strengths of the University of Nottingham in solar energy, micro/nano coating and low carbon buildings, and thus facilitates a two-way knowledge transfer and training.

The huge energy storage-demand involves an explosion of the battery production, which will face in the future the problem of limited resources, unlocated in Europe. Therefore, it is important to investigate alternative batteries. Recent years have seen the emergence of post-LiB, like sodium-, magnesium- or calcium technologies. The last one is very promising in terms of theoretical energy density, safety, and sustainability. However, the lack of reliable electrolytes so far impedes the practical research on rechargeable calcium batteries, CaB.

In tandem with advances in sequestering carbon, beneficial uses for CO2 are of high societal importance for developing a sustainable future. One attractive use of CO2 is in its conversion to energy dense fuels (green energy vectors). One such fuel is methanol, made from CO2 via hydrogenation in conjunction with a multimetallic catalyst. The current best industrial (heterogeneous) catalyst incorporates copper and zinc-oxide nanoparticles with an alumina support. A special synergy is observed between the copper (active site) and zinc (reaction promoter), but these species and their connection is poorly defined and remains debated.This project aims to isolate proximal copper and zinc centres, the fundamental building block for the construction of critical copper–zinc interfaces, within a well-defined, and highly tuneable ligand framework. Once isolated, the binding, activation and interconversion of key intermediates along the CO2 hydrogenation pathway will be meticulously analysed.Work package 1 involves the synthesis and characterisation of a series of 12 ligands that encompass a range of stereo-electronic profiles, and subsequent isolation of CuZn complexes using these ligands. Work package 2 will use the complexes to study the activation and interconversion of key intermediates along the CO2 hydrogenation pathway to gain mechanistic understanding. Finally, work package 3 will test the most active complexes as catalysts for the direct hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol.The combination of my skills (multimetallic systems) and the host groups (mechanistic studies) make achieving the project aims realistic.

Buildings in the European Union (EU) are responsible for 40% of the overall power consumption and 36% of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. Meanwhile, nearly half of the structures in the seismic regions of the EU exhibit substandard seismic resistance, posing a severe threat to life safety and economy. The poor seismic performance of old buildings in the recent earthquakes in Italy and Greece caused significant economic losses, injuries, and loss of human lives. Currently, the annual cost of repair and maintenance of the European building stock is estimated to be approximately 50% of the total construction budget, exceeding €300 billion. Replacing the old buildings with new ones entails considerable financial, environmental, and social cost, which cannot be undertaken; therefore, extending the service life of buildings requires structural upgrade innovations that reduce their seismic vulnerability and boost their energy efficiency at the same time, and in the least expensive and invasive way possible. NOTICE-EUB explores a cost-effective retrofit approach, which combines advanced thermal insulation materials with engineered wood panels to provide simultaneous seismic-plus-energy upgrading. The proposed retrofit concept takes advantage of the high structural performance of the emerging cross-laminated timber (CLT) technology and the superior thermal properties of advanced insulation materials. The research activities comprise experiments on components and a full-scale building specimen to validate the efficiency of the advanced CLT systems, and to provide data for the calibration of numerical models. State-of-the-art analyses will evaluate the economic benefits of the proposed hybrid retrofit scheme.

At best, a 15% decrease in the overall CO2 intensity of the sector could be achieved throughout the widespread dissemination of technologies that could reasonably become cost-effective in the future. Therefore, breakthrough technologies are urgent and indispensable. ΣIDERWIN project proposes to develop a breakthrough innovation compared to the actual steel production process bringing together steel making with electrochemical process. The electrolysis process using renewable energies will transform any iron oxide, including those inside the by-products from other metallurgies, into steel plate with a significant reduction of energy use. This process decomposes under mild conditions but at intense reaction rate naturally occurring iron oxides such as hematite into iron metal and oxygen gas. By offering a CO2-free steel production process, the project will contribute to the reduction of the total greenhouse gas emissions.Compared to traditional steelmaking plants, this innovative technology has several positive impacts such as: a reduction by 87% of the direct CO2 emissions; a reduction by 31% of the direct energy use; the ability to produce steel from by-products rich in iron oxides from non-ferrous metallurgy residues; an increased integration with renewable energies with a more flexible process.The project is led by ArcelorMittal the world’s leading steel and mining company.

The problem is that it has not been possible to produce aerogels at a cost low enough for them to be anything other than a niche product, until now. Svenska Aerogel has developed an aerogel-type nano-material “Quartzene®” which can be produced at a 70-90% reduction in cost. This will allow for a market uptake of this aerogel across a number of industry segments, in the EU and globally.Quartzene® can be used as insulation in many applications, from buildings and household appliances to food packaging. This is important since effective insulation is vital in order to solve the problem with climate change. Especially considering that buildings are responsible for 40% of energy consumption and 36% of CO2 emissions in the EU. Using Quartzene as thermal insulation in existing buildings in the EU could potentially lower CO2-emissions from heating and cooling by 42% (353 million tons per year). In the proposed project Svenska Aerogel will allow three European companies and one company from the Republic of Korea to perform the final verification of Quartzene® as insulation material on a tonne scale, in an operational environment. The project will also verify the final design of the first future full scale plants that Svenska Aerogel or its customers (through licensing agreements) aim to operate in the EU.By the end of the project, Quartzene® will be ready for commercial use as an insulation material (i.e TRL 9) and by Q2 2018 made available for a number of customers, some who have already signed agreements with Svenska Aerogel.

One of the most important stages in the water cleaning systems, specifically in potable water treatment (PWT) facilities, is the aeration systems. This process consists in the use of oxygen from the air  to generate a kinetic diffusion into the raw water, where oxygen moves from the air to the water, oxidizing, and boosting the growth of micro-organisms which absorb, process and deactivate dissolved chemicals and foreign matter. Water oxidation also allows to separate iron, metals and other different particles from the water. The current air injection technologies used in PWT plants to oxygenate water incur in high energy costs, due to the high electric consumption of the air pumping equipment. Air injection systems consume about 50% of total electricity used in PWT facilities .  We estimate that electricity costs of aeration at a European municipal PWT facility for a community of 200,000 people amount to around €204 K annually.  Thanks to SANSOX technology, forced pumping air is not necessary. Instead of this, effortless 100% oxygen saturation (efficiency) is achieved by kinetic diffusion (movement of molecules or atoms from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration, produced for the kinetic energy of these particles), without electricity consumptions, saving up to 50% of total PWT costs.  Clean water with natural balance of gases and minerals plays the central role in the quality of life of people, their health and contributes for higher life expectancy.

Besides, sharp increases in energy tariffs almost doubled the energy bills that irrigators have to pay, which accounts for up to 40% of the total irrigation costs for farmers’ communities. In a context exacerbated by the ongoing climate change, European farmers are striving to reduce their water footprint by means of water saving irrigation technologies while optimising their energy costs for pumping, with the aim to ensure long- term economic and environmental sustainability.

The main objective is to pilot deconstruction and reuse towards maturity as a socio-technical system. The project develops the transition towards circular construction by investigating the systemic changes needed in the whole ecosystems of construction and demolition. Drawing from partnerships that cover the entire value chain, ReCreate will demonstrate deconstruction of intact precast components from condemned buildings and reuse thereof in new buildings in four real-life innovative pilots. The pilots examine the challenge of circularity against the feature of the industry being relatively local, taking into account differences in precasting technologies, building types, construction industry structures and regulatory environments in the different countries. To develop technology and integrate the value chain so that the businesses can become viable, the project advances smart pre-deconstruction audit and deconstruction methods; rapid low-cost quality assurance and standardization; logistics, traceability, and BIM and digital market place integration; and novel design practices and reassembly techniques. In addition ReCreate analyses the potential volume of the supply and demand for secondary concrete components in the EU; reviews how concrete reuse can help the EU to reach its ambitious energy and climate targets for 2030; investigates how secondary components can become socially acceptable for relevant stakeholders and citizens; and elaborates on the changes needed to the regulatory environment to support reuse.",2021-04-01,2025-03-31,48.0,SIGNED,12494045.02,14269829.0,['energy'],,"['energy consumption', 'building', 'smart', 'climate', 'buildings']",5

The transport sector is a major contributor to these emissions, but the targets for this sector cannot be met with currently available materials technology. Due to the direct link between weight and energy consumption, EU investment in advancing lightweight technologies is crucial. Therefore, fibre-reinforced composites are a key technology, but they are not yet widely used due (1) to their high price, (2) overdesign due to a lack of toughness and (3) difficulties with recycling. Addressing these challenges through fibre-hybridisation requires a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with a strong background in both modelling and experimentation. Since such combined expertise is scarce, HyFiSyn aims to train 13 early stage researchers to become interdisciplinary, multi-talented experts. The 8 universities, 5 industrial partners and 2 professional training organisations offer the researchers a unique opportunity to be trained by world-leading experts in cutting-edge technologies, where they are supported by a strong network and industry participation. The training programme strongly emphasises entrepreneurship and innovation skills to maximise the impact of the project, thereby increasing the EU’s innovation capacity. Simultaneously, the researchers will be trained through research by developing and experimentally validating advanced simulation tools to predict optimal microstructures for fibre-hybrid composites. These microstructures will then be manufactured and verified in industrial applications. To further increase its impact, HyFiSyn also designs hybrids with smart and functional properties, and will investigate strategies for more efficient usage of recycled fibres through fibre-hybridisation.

Climate change is shortening the ski season because of less snow precipitation and of higher average winter temperature. Ski resorts have to counteract the lack of natural snow, and to guarantee the opening of ski district in the most touristic periods. Current snowmaking techniques (fans and cannons) require an air temperature below 0°C and low humidity, thus are not applicable for large part of the season. NeveXN developed a technology able to produce high quality snow at temperatures above 0°, in all weather condition and without any chemical additives. SnowRESolution is a clean-tech snowmaker that works also when traditional snowmakers cannot be operated. The technology is based on the refrigeration cycle and exploits the triple point of water, a condition that occurs at 0°C and almost in vacuum (6mbar) at which the three phases of ice, liquid, and vapour are in equilibrium. The compressor is driven by thermal energy that is provided by renewable energy sources, which may be either a solar thermal collector or a biomass steam boiler. Winter tourism is very important in all mountain regions, and risk to undergo to huge losses if slopes are bare. SnowRESolution address the market of ski resorts that want to guarantee the production of snow also when ambient temperature is above 0°C, enabling an early opening of the ski season.

In response to these concerns, Rapidly Developing Countries are currently seeking to tap its vast renewable energy potential (IRENA 2013). This shift to renewable energy provides a unique opportunity to study socio-technical transition to low-carbon technologies. Transitioning to renewable energy requires policy reform, infrastructure investment, citizen mobilization, and smart financing mechanisms. The RE-DEV project will examine the conditions for the take-up of renewable energy in Rapidly Developing Countries and, by doing so, uncover its consequences in terms of global CO2 emissions. Drawing on a comparative study of four selected country-cases (China, India, South Africa, and Morocco), this project will offer an in-depth analysis of: (a) regulatory frameworks and existing financing mechanisms, (b) the limits and potential of multilateral climate cooperation, (c) the state of vertical/horizontal transfer of know-how. The country sample responds to a most-dissimilar-systems research design. To gather evidence, this project will employ the following methods: semi-structured interviews with policy makers, questionnaires and a participatory assessment with public/private stakeholders. As a result of this, the RE-DEV project will build knowledge on how to facilitate a sustained transition to renewable energy in Rapidly Developing Countries.

Heating crops roots is essential to obtain higher yields, but existing technologies fail to direct the energy to the crops, heating the whole greenhouse instead. This has a large cost in terms of energy consumption (up to 40% energy waste) and GHG emissions and promotes pest infestation. With AgrowFab, we aim to commercialize a cost-efficient and sustainable technology consisting on a smart fabric that radiates heat as Far Infrared radiation (FIR). The fabric is made from nylon fibres coated with a proprietary non-metal carbon compound, making them electrically conductive. Our product’s nature (lightweight and mechanically flexible) allows its application to surface of any kind/size, and, thanks to a powerful control algorithm, it can be combined with other smart management systems to simultaneously control heating, irrigation and fertilization cycles, therefore enabling the complete management of the root-zone environment. AgrowFab controls the root’s capacity to absorb oxygen, water and nutrients on-demand, enhancing crop yields by 35%, while minimizing the energy waste (at least 40% lower) through accurate and faster (35-45%) temperature delivery.

Gas fermentation using these bacteria has already been realized on an industrial level in two pre-commercial 100,000 gal/yr demonstration facilities to produce fuel ethanol from abundant waste gas resources (by LanzaTech). Acetogens can metabolise a wide variety of substrates that could be used for the production of biocommodities. However, their broad use to produce biofuels and platform chemicals from substrates other than gases or together with gases is hampered by our very limited knowledge about their metabolism and ability to use different substrates simultaneously. Nearly nothing is known about regulatory processes involved in substrate utilization or product formation but this is an absolute requirement for metabolic engineering approaches. The aim of this project is to provide this basic knowledge about metabolic routes in the acetogenic model strain Acetobacterium woodii and their regulation. We will unravel the function of “organelles” found in this bacterium and explore their potential as bio-nanoreactors for the production of biocommodities and pave the road for the industrial use of A. woodii in energy (hydrogen) storage. Thus, this project creates cutting-edge opportunities for the development of biosustainable technologies in Europe.",2017-10-01,2023-09-30,72.0,SIGNED,2497140.0,2497140.0,['energy'],,"['building', 'climate']",2

Recent studies  on the characterization of C&DW samples at European level revealed a predominant fraction of concrete (52% average). Over the last years, novel technology has been developed aiming to guarantee high quality recycled concrete aggregates for use in new concrete, thereby closing the concrete loop. The most advanced concrete recycling technologies currently produce coarse (>4mm) recycled concrete aggregates by removing cement paste from the surface of the aggregates. However, the fine (0-4 mm) fraction, ca. 40% of the concrete waste, still faces technical barriers to be incorporated into new concrete and consequently, is often down-cycled. At the other extreme, there are minor (e.g. glass) and emerging (e.g. mineral wool) C&DW materials, currently accounting for 0.7% of the total, but revealing growing rates as consequence of European regulations. Those emerging C&DW streams have not yet found technological and business solutions, being mostly landfilled. On the other hand, concrete is the most widely used material in building, with a growing trend towards prefabrication. The European precast concrete sector faces diverse needs for resource efficiency improvement (reduction in natural resource consumption and metabolization of waste materials, reduction in carbon footprint and embodied energy, design for reuse, increase in process efficiency and waste minimization, lighter solutions, enhanced thermal performance through novel cost-effective insulating materials). Aiming at facing these challenges, VEEP main objective is to eco-design, develop and demonstrate new cost-effective technological solutions that will lead to novel closed-loop circular approaches for C&DW recycling into novel multilayer precast concrete elements (for both new buildings and refurbishment) incorporating new concretes as well as superinsulation material produced by using at least 75% (by weight) of C&DW recycled materials.",2016-10-01,2021-03-31,54.0,SIGNED,4929753.75,4929753.75,['energy'],['energy'],"['building', 'buildings']",2

Sustainable chemistry-ably to supply society with key chemical products in an eco-compatible manner-has therefore rapidly become an urgent challenge. The AlCHiMIE aims at providing new solutions towards this important defy by developing a set of complementary approaches to convert hydrocarbons, the simplest feedstock, into high value-added chiral alkanes-essential building blocks for medicinal chemistry. Two approaches are thus proposed. First, undirected, metal-free functionalization of hydrocarbons will be achieved by means of regio- and stereo-selective hypervalent bromine-enabled C-H functionalization. This unique reactivity will be attaint by discovering a largely uncharted, yet extremely appealing field of bromanes. The second approach concerns earth-abundant metal-catalyzed C(sp3)-H activation. To obviate the inherent difficulties of this field, namely the low reactivity of alkanes and arduous stereoinduction while using 3d metals, I will develop bifunctional ligands for Co- and Ni-catalyzed C-H activation. In addition to the role of metal coordination, these ligands featuring a second coordinating motif, will enhance the metallation event and will promote the substrate’s activation, thus unlocking the door towards previously inaccessible modes of reactivity. The combination of both strategies will allow unprecedented hydrocarbon valorization by means of undirected, hypervalent bromine-enabled first functionalization followed by exploiting the newly installed coordinating motif to promote directed, asymmetric Co- and Ni-catalyzed C-H activations. Finally, I will also endeavor in establishing new reactivities arising from the application of diversely substituted  hypervalent bromines as coupling partners in enantioselective Co- and Ni-catalyzed C-H activations.",2021-06-01,2026-05-31,60.0,SIGNED,1499800.0,1499800.0,['energy'],,"['building', 'energy demand']",2

They can be made semi-transparent which is an appealing feature for building or automobile integrated photovoltaics. But to be efficient, they have to harvest a maximum of photons from the sun, thus the best-performing DSSCs cannot show a good transparency which impedes their use as windows.

To foster their pervasive adoption in a vast scope of new applications and markets, a step forward is needed towards the implementation of the on-line classification task (called inference) on low-power embedded systems, enabling a shift to the edge computing paradigm. Nevertheless, when DL is moved at the edge, severe performance requirements must coexist with tight constraints in terms of power/energy consumption, posing the need for parallel and energy-efficient heterogeneous computing platforms. Unfortunately, programming for this kind of architectures requires advanced skills and significant effort, also considering that DL algorithms are designed to improve precision, without considering the limitations of the device that will execute the inference.

This will provide low-cost and financially sustainable EL V solutions and “gamified” services, to enhance users’ awareness, engagement and vehicle energy efficiency.A core item of STEVE is a low-cost electric quadricycle developed by a worldwide OEM in Turin, with start-of-production expected in 2018 at a market price of €8000. The quadricycle will integrate high-technology contents with respect to the current competitors, and will be pilot-tested, together with many other EL-Vs, during extensive demonstration phases in the four STEVE citiesSTEVE will guarantee a strong impact in terms of business development and jobs, and enhance the European competitiveness in the eMaaS sector while also leveraging Manufacturing.The consortium will also give a primary role to SMEs: while large enterprises will provide the underlying technologies, the services will be mainly designed and operated by SMEs, deeply involved in the local supply chains and adaptable to the specific customers’ needs.",2017-11-01,2021-02-28,40.0,CLOSED,7429674.76,9484981.06,['energy'],,"['city', 'cities', 'urban']",3

In this challenge,  households in each region form teams that will be provided with smart plug equipment and a smartphone app allowing them to monitor and control their electricity consumption and serving as a means to directly communicate with them and support them with tailored energy conservation advice. By combining feedback, prompts, goal setting, peer comparison, rewards and other behavioural levers, the project will lead to an annual reduction in primary energy consumption of more than 14.48 GWh. Throughout the project, data will be generated that allows looking into energy consumption patterns of households and their appliances. Furthermore, the actual potential for energy savings through behavioural change as well as through the application of smart plug technology and similar innovative product-system-services can be monitored and evaluated very precisely. The project will thereby not only contribute to reducing energy consumption in the three target region and to improving the awareness for the innovative smart plug technology but will also advance the scientific and public debate on energy consumption behaviour and on behavioural interventions for energy efficiency. In addition to creating direct energy savings and to building knowledge, the project will also contribute to building capacities and skills among participating households, multipliers in energy agencies across Europe, policy-makers on national and European level as well as municipalities and energy providers.

However, very few solutions, despite validated in lab, have been successfully deployed on operational DCs, mostly due to technological fragmentation, excessive CAPEX and lack of appropriate business models. CATALYST will address these challenges through turning existing/new DCs into flexible multi-energy hubs, which can sustain investments in RES and energy efficiency by offering mutualized flexibility services to the smart energy grids (both electricity and heat grids). By leveraging on the outcomes of FP7 GEYSER and DOLPHIN projects, CATALYST will adapt, scale up, validate and deploy an innovative, adaptable technological and business framework aimed at i) exploiting available DC non-IT legacy assets (onsite RES/backup generation, UPS/batteries, cooling system thermal inertia, heat pump for waste heat reuse) to deliver simultaneous energy flexibility services to multi-energy coupled electricity/heat/IT load marketplaces ii) deploying Cross-DC cross-infrastructures (e.g. heat vs IT) IT workload orchestration, by combining heat-demand driven HPC geographical workload balancing, with traceable ICT-load migration between federated DCs to match IT demands with time-varying on-site RES (“follow the energy approach”) iii) providing marketplace-as-a-service tools to nurture novel ESCO2.0 business models.

The main drivers behind this paradigm shift are related to the improved efficiency, flexibility, security and reliability DC grids may provide, thus increasing the sustainability of the energy distribution system. However, there is a need for demonstration of DC technologies and grid topologies so that these solutions are able to evolve from a promising solution for the future smart grids to a commercially available technological option.Under this context, TIGON aims to achieve a smooth deployment and integration of intelligent DC-based grid architectures within the current energy system while providing ancillary services to the main network. To do so, TIGON proposes a four-level approach aiming at improving 1) Reliability, 2) Resilience 3) Performance, and 4) Cost Efficiency of hybrid grids through the development of an innovative portfolio of power electronic solutions and software systems and tools focused on the efficient monitoring, control and management of DC grids. These solutions will be demonstrated in two main Demo-Sites located in France and Spain, while additional use cases in the residential and urban railway sectors will act as niche markets for analysing and further solidifying the replication of TIGON developments after the project’s end.TIGON has involved for this purpose a multidisciplinary team of 15 partners from 8 different European Member States with a well-balanced consortium integrated by 7 non-profit entities and 7 companies.

In this PoC project, based on these promising results, we will further develop these basic devices to a TRL5 self-powered biocompatible core technology for an e-skin device. Our vision is to turn our core material into a key component of next generation compact and self-powered wearable and implantable systems, targeting biomedical applications as a market entry point.

In particular, the IoT offers tremendous socio-economic and environmental benefits through the improved automation and energy efficiency of Smart Homes, Buildings and Industrial Plants.Most IoT applications demand that devices provide the range of WiFi. In addition, devices must be standards-based, highly secure, globally interoperable, reliable, ultra-low power and cost effective.However, existing IoT technology is failing to meet these market needs. Current 2.4GHz radios have limited range and sub-GHz radios do not give security or global interoperability. There are two ways to increase the range of radio devices: 1) increase transmit power or 2) improve the radio’s receiver sensitivity (Rx sensitivity). However, legislation in Europe limits transmit power to 10dBm, meaning the only practical way to increase range is to improve Rx sensitivity. Cascoda has developed a disruptive 2.4GHz wireless transceiver based on a unique patent-protected radio architecture, which significantly improves Rx sensitivity, effectively doubling the range without using any external power amplifiers. This delivers the range of WiFi to provide whole-house coverage, reduces power consumption by a factor of 6 enabling years of operation from batteries, provides high security, reliability and reduces equipment costs by a factor 5 as no power amplifiers are needed. Extensive R&D and market feasibility studies including a Eureka Eurostars and a H2020 Phase 1 project, have taken us this far. This Phase 2 project will allow us to optimise, refine and certify our products under industry standards and demonstrate our systems under real-world conditions.

Software evolves to implement new features, adapt to new hardware and platforms, fix bugs and security vulnerabilities, or improve non-functional properties such as performance and energy consumption.While these changes have an overall positive impact, they are also responsible for a large number of critical bugs and security attacks. The reason is twofold: first, software changes are not vetted enough, due to the difficulty of reasoning about all possible new behaviours that they introduce. Second, even when critical errors in deployed changes are later discovered and fixed, users take a long time to update their software to the latest version, mostly because they are concerned about the potential negative impact of an update.The PASS project aims to tackle both problems and help software evolve safely and securely. It takes a holistic approach to the challenges of safe and secure software evolution, by combining offline program analysis to verify or comprehensively test software changes, with runtime mechanisms for keeping the software updated and secure against potentially erroneous changes that make it into the deployed system.This is an ambitious project, which requires fundamental advances at the intersection of program analysis, software engineering, and computer systems to develop practical cross-version specifications, scalable patch verification, in-production testing and analysis, and low-overhead reversible software updates.",2019-10-01,2024-09-30,60.0,SIGNED,1955129.0,1955129.0,['energy'],,"['energy consumption', 'positive']",2

Quantifying the performance gap is non-trivial, the performance gap is dependent on time and contextual factors, and individual buildings will have a particular performance gap. The delivery of energy efficiency projects through energy performance contracts and ESCOs is widely seen as a way of addressing sub-optimal post installation performance of energy efficiency technologies. Since this model is very attractive from many perspectives and is identified as a central route to delivery of energy efficiency gains in the EPBD, methods and models for the accurate measurement and verification of energy savings are essential to the growth of the ESCO market. The energy audit process is generally done for a fixed duration at a specific point in time. A key outcome is the identification and root cause analysis of energy inefficiencies and as a result a plan is put in place to minimise these inefficiencies. This can be very effective at reducing energy consumption in a building. However, from an implementation perspective, it can be difficult to identify all issues (in some cases conflicting system level goals) and the persistence of savings can be poor and as a consequence inefficiencies re-appear. Continuous energy auditing takes this one-off process and makes it a constant rolling cycle where a detailed overview of the building performance is consistently available making it possible to refine the energy management plan.

It will utilise packages of interconnected energy systems that achieve a balance between energy efficiency and renewable energy measures. This is enabled by enhancing renewable technologies capacity factors by using advanced building management systems with machine learning algorithms that allow building system integration and auto-optimisation across building dimensions. Currently, deep energy renovations mainly focus on building-level solutions, where, cost-effectively, an energy demand reduction of 40-50% can be achieved. In district scale projects, technologies for energy generation, storage and management can be integrated cost-effectively, reducing up to an additional 25-35% of Net Energy Demand.

Sustainable urban planning helps improve the welfare of the community, shaping public areas into clean and efficient spaces to live. On the other hand, IoT is changing the way in which cities are operating by enabling effective infrastructure management. The Solar Hub is a new concept of solar urban furniture which converts smart street lighting into an IoT enabling smart city tool. Conventional street lighting is associated with high energy and maintenance requirements, resulting in high costs for municipalities. Although energy efficient lighting solutions are gaining ground, they often fall short of addressing the sustainable development of Smart Cities: lack of aesthetic appeal, no-use of solar energy, difficult integration of sensors and smart devices and not designed for a long term retrofitting. SIARQ addresses all these challenges in a single solution, championing a new concept of solar urban furniture. The Solar Hub belongs to the new generation of Cradle to Cradle zero CO2 emissions products entirely powered by the Sun. It stands out by its dome-shaped lightweight photovoltaic module that houses environmental sensors and other smart devices that enable different kinds of monitoring. SIARQ thus actively contributes to overcoming the lack of interoperable solutions and the risk of fragmentation that have been acknowledged by the European Commission as major challenges to the deployment and exploitation of the IoT potential. SIARQ’s business model targets Telecoms, IT service providers and Energy Service Companies as preferential channels to reach the end users and to generate new business models with shared incomes.

InnoDC's 14 participants prepare 15 early career researchers to play their role in the energy transition that will take place over the next 20-40 years.The project focusses on the development of the electricity transmission system, targeting the connection of offshore wind, the integration of offshore wind with the existing power system (including the use of HVDC), and the operation of the future power system where large scale wind is connected to a hybrid AC and DC power system.Technological development for offshore wind is ongoing. This research project focusses on the models and methodologies for the integration of these new technologies (e.g. offshore wind turbines, VSC HVDC converters, long AC cables) into thepower system. Challenges in these areas will be addressed in this project: firstly, these new devices behave inherently differently to traditional power system components. Secondly, the multi-actor/intersectoral nature of these systems means that they have distinct elements and devices interfacing with each other, each with limited information of the overall system.The project will train the researchers in developing prototype tools to aid the developers and users of these new energy systems.This training network aims to train the researchers of the future in the pivotal sector of renewable energy and grid technology, which is largely led by research and industry.

As explained in the EU Third Energy Package the SG will support a dynamic two-way information exchange between utility companies and their customers, contributing towards a smart and sustainable energy management in Europe and the establishment of a wiser energy consumption mentality. However, besides the benefits of such an endeavour, the power grid will be exposed to security threats inherited from the ICT sector, while privacy issues and new vulnerabilities, related to the specific characteristics of the SG infrastructure, will emerge. The problem is assessed as crucial, if we consider that a potential attack to the SG may lead to cascading failures, ranging from destruction of other interconnected critical infrastructures to loss of human lives. Thus, the development of a security platform tailored to the SG is required, that i) can efficiently manage the plethora of SG nodes, ii) deal with potential malicious hardware or software modifications due to the physical access of the customers to the SG nodes, and iii) operate over heterogeneous systems. Considering all the above, SealedGRID aims at bringing together experts from industry and academia from cross-sectorial research areas having complementary background with the long-term goal to design, analyse, and implement a scalable, highly trusted and interoperable SG security platform.

Forest transitions have recently resulted in declining rates of global net deforestation and contributed to carbon (C) sinks in terrestrial ecosystems. Studies have shown the concurrence of forest transitions and industrialization processes, but the systemic links between forest transitions, their underlying socio-metabolic processes and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been neither systematically explored nor quantified.HEFT introduces the idea of “hidden emissions of forest transitions”, i.e. the GHG emissions from socio-metabolic processes reducing pressures on forests. Hidden emissions may stem from processes such as substitution of fuelwood by modern energy sources, intensification of agriculture, and externalization of biomass production to remote regions. Building on the concept of socio-ecological metabolism, HEFT develops a consistent methodological framework to quantify the full GHG emissions and sinks from socio-metabolic and ecological processes in the course of forest transitions, within which their hidden emissions are identified. Forest transitions in multiple contexts are analyzed at local, national and supranational scales: in Europe since c. 1850, North America since c. 1880, and South East Asia since 1980. A coarse global-scale assessment complements the regional case studies.We will integrate sources and analytical methods from environmental and social sciences as well as the humanities to analyze context-specific trajectories and general features of socio-ecological GHG budgets and their respective socio-political contexts since the onset of forest transitions.

13433,Motorlisten,AI-based acoustic condition monitoring of industrial machinery,827712,"""Before the break, mechanical objects emit unusual noises - machines talk and grumble. These grumbles are warning signals that a fault is developing, which if left untreated can lead to motor failure and unscheduled downtime in the facility. At costs of up to €300,000+ per hour, unplanned downtime is a very big problem for industrial plants and utilities alike. OneWatt has invented a non-invasive predictive maintenance system, combining an auditory sensor (""""EARS""""), which picks up a machine's grumbles, with an AI machine-learning algorithm. The system, developed to TRL 7, can detect and predict physical faults in machinery - and can tell maintenance staff not only that a fault is developing but exactly how, where and when the fault will happen. The system emulates an expert mechanic, who can identify faults just by hearing motor sounds, but because it uses AI and an infinitely larger data set than a human can experience, it is much more reliable than any human could be - and scalable. This will optimize maintainance work and minimize downtime, a big priority for industrial companies and utilities, who will be the initial customer targets. The potential market is global, worth an estimated € 3bn+. OneWatt's system will help companies implement a much more targeted, cost-effective """"smart maintenance"""" strategy and become part of Industry 4.0 technology and the """"Industrial Internet of Things"""". OneWatt's system will also be very attractive for other industries that have assets that emit acoustic signals, such as gearboxes or valves. Future target markets will include wind turbines, heat pumps and water distribution equipment.

The vast majority of these devices is equipped with a battery, which results in one of the main obstacles to make a success of the IoT-revolution. The costs of the battery and battery replacement every 3 to 5 years are disproportionate to the total cost of a low power IoT-device, and therefore a major bottleneck for industry companies to start implementing IoT-ecosystems. Furthermore the battery replacement of IoT-devices results in vast amounts of chemical waste and constitutes a complex logistical challenge since a typical low power IoT-ecosystem consists in general of thousands of devices at hard to reach places  TWTG R&D B.V. has developed the Tryst module, a sustainable and cost-efficient alternative for batteries by means of light energy harvesting for IoT-devices. The Tryst module harvests enough energy to continuously supply an IoT-sensor in very low light conditions, since it requires only 200 lux light for 4 hours per day. Tryst is the ideal solution since it provides IoT-energy supply which is 13 times more cost-efficient than conventional batteries and dismisses complex battery replacement campaigns. In addition Tryst reduces the projected amounts of chemical waste caused by battery usage in IoT-ecosystems.  Therefore the Tryst module is the breakthrough innovation, which will make vast and growing amounts of IoT-batteries dispensable and a necessary enabler to further accelerate the IoT-revolution. To convince the market of the added value of the Tryst module a demonstration project needs to be executed.

It would be obvious to adjust the frequency of pass of gondolas, chair lifts or ropeways in general to the number of users that are waiting. In a ski resort, that number uses to be low most of time, workdays. Therefore, a system able to automatically know how long people must wait and able to modify the ropeway speed according to it, could noticeably reduce the energy consumption and would offer a better service during the rush hour.Ropeways have the possibility of manually modifying their speed already, a task that can be performed by the driver. Nevertheless, regarding the experience of ski resorts managers, it is more critical asking him/her to take care of the boarding manoeuvres of users than optimizing the ropeway speed, hence that last uses to turn at its nominal speed.Blue Snow is an integrated system that:1. Determines the queue waiting-time in the boarding area of a ropeway and informs about it to users and facility managers. This part has been pilot-tested.2. Automatically optimizes the speed of the ropeway so that it can save energy and it prevents queues.

Yet, they are threatened by human impact and climate change, highlighting the need to develop tools and strategies to curtail changes in these ecosystems. Remarkably, ever since Darwin’s descriptions of coral reefs, it has been a mystery how one of Earth’s most productive and diverse ecosystems thrives in oligotrophic seas, as an oasis in a marine desert. My team recently discovered the ‘sponge loop’ pathway (Science, De Goeij et al 2013) that efficiently retains and transfers energy and nutrients on the reef. We recognized sponges as potential (and so far neglected) key ecosystem drivers, and accumulated evidence on sponge loops in other ecosystems, such as deep-sea coral reefs. As a result, current reef food web models, lacking sponge-driven resource cycling, are incomplete and need to be redeveloped. However, mechanisms that determine the capacity of sponge 'engines', how they are fuelled, and drive communities are unknown.     This proposal will systematically establish the novel reef food web framework, integrating sponges as key ecosystem drivers. To this end, sponges will be evaluated on functional traits (morphology, associated microbes, pumping rate) in the processing of dissolved food, the main fuel of the engine. At the community level, we will assess to what extent these different traits are a driving force in structuring reef ecosystems, from fuel input (primary producers), to engine output (driving and modulating the consumer food web). This framework derived from a Caribbean reef ecosystem will be implemented in a sponge-driven food web model, a much-needed foundation to test and predict future scenarios of changes in reef communities. Ultimately, I will test and generalize the novel food web framework at a tropical Indo-Pacific, a temperate Mediterranean, and a cold-water North-Atlantic reef, together with my international collaborators.",2017-01-01,2021-12-31,60.0,SIGNED,1465097.0,1465097.0,['energy'],,"['communities', 'climate', 'community']",3

Improving the energy efficiency of existing buildings can and should be achieved through deep renovation. In comparison, smart technologies can increase the efficiency and the flexibility of buildings in a shorter term and with much less investments. The domOS project addresses the smart building sector through two axes.In the first axis, technology, guidelines for an open, secure, multi-service Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem for smart buildings are defined: in-building gateways, which connect to local smart devices and smart appliance of any type, IoT platforms and applications operated by different parties can be integrated seamlessly. Buildings owners can enforce privacy rules, they can allow / forbid access to any measurement or control point.The second axis deals with the development of smart services. They increase energy efficiency of space heating (heat pumps, district heating, gas boilers) thanks to innovative control algorithms making use of smart sensors and smart heating appliances. Automated advice services provide concise and sound information on the building energy. Buildings become active nodes of an electricity grid or a District Heating grid.These two axes are present in each of the five demonstration sites of the domOS project: The Sion (CH) and Paris (F) pilots test smart services related to electricity.

Energy harvesters convert different forms of environmental energies into electricity thus making devices self-powered. However, with over a decade’s development, energy harvesters have not been able to overtake batteries yet, although academia and industry are keen to apply it in electronics. One of the reasons is that the power level provided by a single-source energy harvester, which most research has been focused on, is not high or stable enough. Therefore, a crucial and urgent question has been raised – how to release the huge potential of energy harvesting technology? This proposed action is addressing the above scientific/engineering question by exploring multi-source energy harvesting on a single piece of material. Perovskite structured materials are able to exhibit piezoelectric, pyroelectric or photovoltaic effect which has been utilised to harvest kinetic, thermal or solar energy separately.

This insight is triangulated with future trends on smart and intelligent cities, transport and energy as key drivers for regional sustainable development and growth (identified via Delphi), to result in techno-moral scenarios depicting potential R&I trajectories and consequent impacts on policy, socioeconomic and environmental level. The scenarios will be “tested” via JRC’s Scenario Exploration System and Regional Dialogues. Their outcomes will form the basis for the elaboration of Regional Agendas and Roadmaps that will describe the concrete steps to be taken towards the integration of RRI principles into territorial R&I design. All activities, outcomes and impacts will be closely monitored by the RRI2SCALE Monitoring and Evaluation Framework, which will include a set of customised indicators for mapping the impact pathways between regional innovation and RRI. All project results, together with a training compendium on how to perform the project activities, will form the RRI2SCALE Toolkit for replication by other territories. A Memorandum of Collaboration will be signed by all regions (participating/interested), to further the sustainability of the project’s outcomes.",2020-01-01,2022-12-31,36.0,SIGNED,1999775.0,2009981.0,['energy'],['energy'],"['smart', 'cities']",2

This goal requires a major effort to increase the number of qualified construction specialists at all levels, which is directly related to the accessibility and quality of the training and educational programmes and the inclusion of training on intelligent energy efficiency and RES solutions in building renovation. Responding to these needs, the project is designed to:(i)Elaborate a set of technological competences and learning outcomes on deep energy renovation;(ii)Develop new large scale training schemes and programmes on deep energy renovation at all levels of the vocational education and training (VET) system;(iii)Review the national educational plans and initiate the necessary changes;(iv)Establish capacity for professional training of trainers and train a sufficient number of trainers;(v)Support and monitor pilot courses on the new programmes on deep energy renovation at all levels.The leading objective of the Fit-to-nZEB project proposal is to deliver all necessary requisites for the introduction of educational content on deep energy renovation of buildings in the curricula at all levels of the educational and training system in Southeastern Europe. This will be done both through incorporation of new educational content in existing curricula and through the development of new specialized programs. This process will be guided by the understanding of the complex nature of building retrofit, combining various building disciplines and allowing integrated design and cross-craft understanding with special focus on practical exercises and demonstrations.

The reliability of the predictions depends on building the best understanding of these processes. Changes in the global carbon cycle are a source of major uncertainty in models and terrestrial carbon stored in peatlands is a critical element of this. The action proposed here will bring state-of-the-art process modelling into global vegetation models that are used in projections of future climate change. An improved understanding of peatland dynamics and functions will also have implications for management and climate mitigation strategies for wetlands, agriculture, land-use, and energy. I have worked extensively in North America on one of the most sophisticated peatland process models. I will work with Dan Charman and Angela Gallego-Sala at Exeter to build this model in to one of the most widely used dynamic global vegetation models so that peatlands and their carbon balance are better represented within global climate models. The work will thus allow quantification of the impact of peatlands on the global carbon cycle in the past and in the future. The action will bring top level expertise in peatland modelling back to Europe and build a bridge between the North American peatland modelling community and those in Europe. It will expose me to training and development in the necessary skills, people and laboratories to take this work forward independently in a European institution in the future. The supervisors at Exeter will develop their already strong record in carbon cycle and climate modelling and further develop links with other European workers and key groups in North America.

They contribute to the underlying principles and processes of a vast range of key sectors such as energy, transportation, manufacturing, and healthcare, and are relevant to the study of climate-change and disease-spreading. Most important to Europe's current challenges, the study of two-phase flows is instrumental in achieving the """"European Green Deal"""" objective of reaching carbon-neutrality by 2050. Yet, despite their clear significance, our understanding of two-phase flows remains limited. Recently, computer simulations have become viable alternatives to experiments for their study, but they are still limited in terms of their flexibility, efficiency, and accuracy.The research programme proposed for this fellowship will provide a paradigm shift in the way two-phase flows can be simulated and therefore studied, with the development of the first high-order numerical framework for the accurate solution of their evolution in complex three-dimensional flow domains. This will entail increasing the order of representation of the local numerical approximations of the interface between the two phases, from linear to quadratic. This enhancement will in turn allow the development of high-order numerical schemes for the transport of this interface, and the estimation of the surface-tension force acting on it. These highly accurate schemes will be released to the research community in an open-source library. Not only will this enable the design of the next generation of low-emission energy-conversion technologies, which are crucially needed to reach Europe's environmental targets, but this will also yield substantial advances in manufacturing and health-related applications and in the prediction of climate-change, and will help devising future environmental and public health policies.""",2021-10-01,2024-09-30,36.0,SIGNED,246669.12,246669.12,['energy'],,"['climate', 'community']",2

One promising way to use this potential is to pelletise the residues for their combustion in CHP plants. This potential is not used, though, as most farmers produce a variety of different residues and none of the currently available pelletising machines is able to process them all simultaneously.Pusch GmbH & Co. KG has developed an innovative new technology which allows the processing of all kinds of agricultural residues as well as mixtures of residues occurring in the EU. A first technical prototype has demonstrated the proper functioning and huge potentials of the technology. However, improvements and adaptations are required to achieve the market breakthrough. In this proposed project a feasibility study will reveal the technical feasibility of the envisaged improvements and the optimal way of implementation, while a business plan will show the optimal way of commercialisation.The new pelletising machine will allow the European farmers to use the full energetic potential of their residues and therefore significantly increase their income while at the same time helping Europe to reach its goals of climate control. At current market prices for pellets an additional turnover of 14 billion € per year can potentially be generated at EU level and up to 137 million tons of CO2 can be saved compared to fossil fuels.

But in the past few years some trends have emerged seeking for quality products with less processing, relying on more sustainable and ecofriendly production methods. Consumers are also eager to grow their own food, as evidenced by the many urban gardens arising in our neighborhoods. Today there are some Do-it-Yourself solutions, small greenhouses and kits that allow people to grow their own vegetables and cooking herbs at homes. However, these urban gardens and orchards pose key limitations with regards to productivity, time required, need for skills, costs, and logistics (water supply, energy), often relying on chemicals to prevent diseases or promote growth. In response, we at Myfood have developed a smart and miniaturized greenhouse solution for cultivation of vegetables, fruits and fish through a permaculture & aquaponics approach. Our solution is conceived to be sustainable (recycled resources, minimized waste, solar energy) and environmentally friendly (no chemicals used, reduced carbon footprint from food processing and transport).

15980,ArtOxiZymes,Artificial Oxidation Enzymes for Highly Selective Waste Free Hydroxylation of Alkanes,657755,"One of the major challenges facing the chemical industries is the sustainable production of chemicals from natural resources. The challenge includes making sure that chemical processes are as ‘green’ and economical as possible, and that sustainable and abundant resources are used where possible. One type of reaction that lends itself to sustainable processes is the direct functionalization of C-H to C-X (X = O, N, C) bonds, as it generates far less chemical waste and leads to tremendous reduction of energy use than methods relying on prefunctionalized materials. The objective of this project is to achieve the C1-selective hydroxylation of n-alkanes to give n-alcohols e.g. octane to octan-1-ol, using mild reaction conditions and green oxidants such as oxygen or hydrogen peroxide, which is currently an unsolved problem. Linear alcohols are of interest as they form some of the major building blocks used in the chemical industries, for example C8-C10 alcohols for the synthesis of plasticisers and detergents. We will achieve this aim by combining traditional homogenous catalysis and biocatalysis for the development of artificial metalloenzymes as catalysts, which utilise the molecular recognition concepts of nature to bind substrates selectively in protein pockets.

The need for upgrading the existing old and CHB is becoming increasingly important for the EU countries, due to: (1) their poor structural performance during recent earthquakes (e.g. Italy, Greece) or other natural hazards (e.g. extreme weather conditions) that have resulted in significant economic losses, and loss of human lives; and (2) their low energy performance which increases significantly their energy consumption (buildings are responsible for 40% of EU energy consumption). Moreover, the SHM of the existing buildings is crucial for assessing continuously their structural integrity and thus to provide information for planning cost effective and sustainable maintenance decisions. Since replacing the old buildings with new is not financially feasible, and even it is not allowed for CHB, their lifetime extension requires considering simultaneously both structural and energy retrofitting. It is noted that the annual cost of repair and maintenance of existing European building stock is estimated to be about 50% of the total construction budget, currently standing at more than €300 billion. To achieve cost effectiveness, STRETCH explores a novel approach, which integrates technical textile reinforcement with thermal insulation systems and strain sensors to provide simultaneous structural-plus-energy retrofitting combined with SHM, tailored for masonry cultural heritage building envelopes.

Although molecular clocks suggest that diatoms evolved over 200 Ma ago, this result has been largely ignored because of the lack of diatoms in the geologic fossil record with most studies therefore focused on diversification during the Cenozoic where abundant diatom fossils are found. Much of the older fossil evidence has likely been destroyed by dissolution during diagenesis, subducted or is concealed deep within the Earth under many layers of rock. DEVOCEAN will provide evidence on diatom evolution and speciation in the geological record by examining formations representing locations in which diatoms are likely to have accumulated in ocean sediments. We will generate robust estimates of the timing and magnitude of dissolved Si drawdown following the origin of diatoms using the isotopic silicon composition of fossil sponge spicules and radiolarians.

This includes ECMWF, the world leader in global NWP together with leading European regional forecasting consortia, teaming up with excellent university research and experienced high-performance computing centres, two world-leading hardware companies, and one European start-up SME, providing entirely new knowledge and technology to the field.""",2015-10-01,2018-09-30,36.0,CLOSED,3977952.5,3977952.5,['energy'],['energy'],"['building', 'climate']",2

Individual and collective energy choices and social acceptance of energy transitions are analysed in a multi-disciplinary process including key stakeholders as co-constructors of the knowledge. To account for the rich contexts in which individuals and collectives administer their energy choices, ECHOES utilizes three complementary perspectives: 1) individual decision-making as part of collectives, 2) collectives constituting energy cultures and life-styles, and (3) formal social units such as municipalities and states. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create a better Energy Union, system change is required. While technological change is a key component in this change, successful implementation of that change relies on the multi-disciplinary social science knowledge that ECHOES produces. Therefore, three broad technological foci which will run as cross-cutting issues and recurrent themes through ECHOES: smart energy technologies, electric mobility, and buildings. All three technology foci address high impact areas that have been prioritised by national and international policies, and are associated with great potential savings in greenhouse gas emissions.ECHOES’ uniquely comprehensive methodological approach includes a representative multinational survey covering all 28 EU countries plus Norway and Turkey, syntheses of existing data and literature, policy assessments, as well as quantitative experiments, interviews, netnography, focus groups, workshops, site visits and case studies in eight countries.

Our Biological Compression technology mimics the neurological processes of the human eye through a non-linear, learning-based approach, creating an innovative class of highly efficient compression algorithms. By building an entirely new foundation for compression, avoiding the limitations of current codecs, our objective is to develop a video compression approach 80% more efficiency than the state-of-the-art.With 85% of all internet traffic being video data, growing exponentially, bandwidth supply is being used up at an unsustainable rate. Even worse, emerging video technologies such as VR-streaming, Medical and Satellite Imaging, and Autonomous driving are bottlenecked by the unavailability of sufficient bandwidth. Further, the amount of energy used and CO2 generated with online video is now being recognised as a major problem.If the EU Digital Single Market and economic growth are to be delivered, and Climate Change obligations met, a more efficient compression system is vital to free up bandwidth and reduce energy usage. Our value proposition is simple, by reducing file sizes by 80%, we directly increase the bandwidth supply of the internet by a factor of 5, thus reducing data transport and storage requirements, reducing energy usage and CO2 emissions.Initially, the end-users of our technology will be content delivery networks, online streaming services and media production organisations.

A first step in this direction is the development and installation of a flexible smart metering architecture for multiple energy vectors. Up to now the smart meters that in some countries are being installed at the users are nearly only devoted to billing improvements. The new metering systems must go much further to provide their contribution to various objectives such as end-user affordability of electricity, energy and market efficiency improvement, CO2 emissions and pollutants reduction. In the FLEXMETER project a flexible, multi-utility, multi-service metering architecture will be designed and deployed in two demonstrators. Simple off-the-shelf meters will be placed at the users for electric, thermal and gas metering; they will communicate with a building concentrator, where the “smartness” of the metering system will reside. A central cloud system will collect data from the building concentrators and from MV/LV substation meters. Data collection, fusion and mining algorithms will be adopted. The proposed architecture will allow for innovative services for the prosumers (e.g. analysis of the energy consumption), for the Distribution System Operators (DSOs) (e.g. fault detection, network balancing and storage integration) and for the retail market. Also demand side management devices could be plugged into the system.

It will be based on and fully exploits the benefits of its core technology – a patented water-based hydraulic actuator with regulation functionality. The novel technology holds a range of clear advantages over compressed air: Energy efficiency and reduced CO2 emission: Reducing electricity consumption and carbon emissions by more than 65%;  Precision: Accurate positioning of valve position allowing any valve to be used for regulation besides fully open/close position. Hygiene: Leak free and sterile hydraulic system prevents spread of air borne bacteria, oil, etc., reducing the risks of food and beverage contamination. Reliability: Reducing waste by avoiding unintended opening of valves and leaks. Avoids cavitation. Cost: Reduces the number of valves needed for a given process, reduces the cost of production and installation of valves, and allows smaller and more flexible plants.The water-based hydraulic actuator system promises to offer a new level of control over valves. To exploit this control to its maximum potential – and thus pave the way for broad market impact - a new process valve would have to be designed, adapted and demonstrated. The technology will have the potential to be adapted for other markets currently using pneumatic valves. It will significantly increase KM’s competitiveness through launching a game changing product in a conservative industry, and opening vast and global market opportunities.HYDRACTVAL will drastically decrease the energy consumption in food and beverage industries, with consequent decrease in greenhouse gas emissions and carbon footprint.

Cement, the key ingredient of concrete, is the source of 8% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions. Due to a lack of available concrete alternatives, CMI is designed and built with little or no ecological consideration, leading to high ecological footprint of structures like ports and coastal defence schemes often resulting in environmental penalties (€900K per acre or mitigation costs through via artificial reefs) and a prolonged permitting process (<1 year).

Stricter regulations (such as 2019/2021 EU Buildings Directive) have led to theuse of huge thicknesses of standard insulation, almost always EPS and XPS.An efficient use of a porous cementitious system as a thermal insulation material depends mainly on its air content.Lightweight concretes have a better thermal insulation capacity than regular-weight ones; however, their use is not efficientenough due to their still too high density.The problem with these insulations is that they store heat/cold sensibly (variation of the body temperature). An innovativesolution would be the employment of a latent heat based Thermal Energy Storage, using the phase transition occurring inpart of the insulation. During the phase transition, the insulation material will absorb/release energy at constant temperature,increasing the system efficiency. A maximization of the synergetic interplay between thermal conductivity and the potential tostore/release energy into components of the building envelope can be achieved by an effective use of Phase ChangeMaterials.A disadvantage of using commercially available Microencapsulated PCMs in building applications is their very low thermalconductivity. To counteract it, graphene can be blended in both the cementitious matrix and the MPCMs in order to achievea targeted increase in thermal conductivity.

The processing of these big data into a meaningful information requires specific machine learning (ML) algorithms, which essentially consist of regression techniques for inference, classification and prediction. The conventional digital computers are not designed to optimally solve these problems with efficient time and energy consumption, which is one of the reasons why the power consumption by data centers worldwide is expected to triple in the next decade. Such a poor energy efficiency is essentially due to the physical separation between the central processing unit (CPU), where data are computed, and the memory, where data are stored, according to classical von Neumann computer architecture.  In the frame of our ERC-CoG RESCUE, my group has developed a new paradigm to efficiently execute ML tasks in just one step within the memory. Instead of moving data from the memory to the digital CPU, an analogue computation is directly operated within the data, thus breaking all previous limits of time and energy consumption (10.000x reduction in the number of operations, hence time, and 1.000x in energy). Our in-memory technology is modular and universal, thus can be implemented in any existing memory and computing technology to accelerate ML tasks in future smartphones and data centers.

As nearly all of Latvia’s stock of multifamily residential buildings continues to rapidly deteriorate due to harsh weather conditions and lack of proper maintenance, the idea is attractive.Realizing this potential requires designing, financing and implementing complex energy efficiency investments, but today nearly all apartments in Latvia are privately owned. Practice shows that individual owners are inadequately organized to manage their collective property. Combined with a lack of awareness and technical knowledge, limited availability of funding, high risk perception and reluctance for debt financing, the barriers overwhelm most people.A concept that addresses these constraints is Energy Performance Contracting (EPC). A key feature of EPC is that the provider, an energy service company (ESCO), guarantees energy savings.SUNShINE supports public and private ESCO's and leads to an innovative investment scheme with a pipeline of projects worth €30m, guaranteed savings over 26GWh/year, and 202020m2 of deeply renovated buildings. A major objective is to demonstrate the financial viability of deep renovation via suitable financial engineering of public funds and private capitals.The proposed approach is simple, yet very innovative: most ESCOs have limited balance sheet capacity and are not able to support much long term debt. So re-financing is usually achieved by selling future cash flows (receivables) by a forfaiting transaction. After this transaction the ESCO continues to guarantee energy savings for the entire EPC term (15-20 years).

WADI aims to develop an airborne water leak detection surveillance service to provide water utilities with adequate information on leaks in water infrastructure outside urban areas, thus enabling the utility to promptly repair them. The project idea relies on innovative concept of coupling optical remote sensing and their application on two complementary aerial platforms, i.e. manned and unmanned, typically used for distinctive purposes in infrastructure performance observation. The former is being used in long-distance monitoring whereas the latter in ‘particular’ areas observation, i.e. those with a limited/difficult physical access or requiring closer monitoring upon earlier detection of some anomalies in aircraft missions. Following the determination of cameras’ optimized wavelengths (suitable particularly for water leaks detection), the WADI technology will be applied in an operational environment represented by two pilot sites, i.e. in France (Provence region, case of water supply mains) and Portugal (Alqueva, case of multi-purpose mains serving irrigation, water supply, and hydro power).

Key to meeting this target is the contribution of energy and both analysis and policy development have been prioritised. The central planks of mitigation practices globally include technological change and efficiency. It is widely acknowledged that the challenge of mitigation fundamentally requires more , as emissions are dependent on the wider development path and underlying driving forces. Within these concepts exists not only the challenge of more complex analysis, but the opportunity of new ways to reduce energy consumption. A neglected but promising option is to look at the social structures underlying material consumption. The perception of mitigation policy is of cost and loss, but there is potential to deliver mitigation while improving peoples´ lives, to maximise wellbeing and minimise emissions.

There is an obvious technological gap in the market, covering the exploitation of low speed air flows, especially in urban environments and areas where the dynamics of air are low and do not allow the installation of common wind turbines. According to the requirements imposed by the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive all new buildings must be nearly zero-energy by the end of 2020. All new public buildings must be nearly zero-energy by 2018. The WindiBox device is comprised of a vertical axis wind turbine, enclosed inside a box-shaped, convergent-divergent casing (diffusers). This casing has been proven to augment the rotational speed of the wind turbine by a factor of at least 2.5, compared to a stand-alone turbine and additionally, enhancing its power output by at least 3 times. WindiBox size of 1m height – 2.5m width – 4m length offers power outputs ranging from 2700-3400kWh annually for wind speed 5m/s. The casing is also utilized to act as an environmental shield for minimal noise and vibration emissions since its extended surface area can be exploited for the addition of insulation. WindiBox overcomes the technological limitations of existing solutions in the market as well as the targeted milestones for CO2 emissions imposed by the European Union.

The systems will be based on electrically driven natural refrigerant heat pumps coupled with renewable electricity generators (PV), using cold (ice slurry), heat and electricity storages to provide heating, cooling and electricity to multi-family residential buildings with a self-consumed renewable share of 80%. TRI-HP systems will include advanced controls, managing electricity, heat and cold in a way that optimizes the performance of the system and increases its reliability via failure self-detection. The flexibility will be achieved by allowing for three heat sources: solar (with ice/water as storage medium), ground and ambient air. The innovations proposed will reduce the system cost by at least 10-15% compared to current heat pump technologies with equivalent energetic performances. Two natural refrigerants with very low global warming potential, propane and carbon dioxide, will be used as working fluids for adapted system architectures that specifically target the different heating and cooling demands across Europe. The newly-developed systems will find application in both new and refurbished multi-family buildings, allowing to cover the major part of Europe’s building stock. The new systems reduce GHG emissions by 75% compared to gas boilers and air chillers. The TRI-HP project will provide the most appropriate knowledge and technical solutions in order to cope with stakeholder’s needs, building demand characteristics, local regulations and social barriers. Two system concepts will be developed for two different combinations of heat sources, i) dual ground/air source and ii) solar with ice-slurry as intermediate storage. These two concepts combined with the two heat pump types developed (CO2 and propane) will lead to three complete systems (CO2-ice, propane-ice and propane-dual) that will be tested in the laboratory.",2019-03-01,2023-02-28,48.0,SIGNED,4993080.0,4993080.0,['energy'],,"['building', 'buildings']",2

SisAl Pilot represents a path-breaking approach, and a strong contribution to “circularity” through industrial symbiosis where the Al industry will act as both a raw material supplier and end user to the Si industry. Across sectors, SisAl Pilot will give substantial reductions in material yield losses, enhanced valorisation of waste- and by-product streams, at a 3 X lower energy consumption and radically lower emissions of CO2 and harmful pollutants, at a considerably lower cost.

Existing commercial electrochromic glasses most often employ thin films of transition metal oxides as the active material which dynamically change color under applied potential. Thus the amount of solar heat and lighting input of the building are controlled. Unfortunately, these glasses suffer from significant drawbacks related to cost, durability, functionality and color. According to ""Electrochromic Glass and Film Markets–2014-2021"", the market for electrochromic (EC) glasses was small - just over $ 15 million in 2015, but it will reach more than $700 million by 2020. The development of simple, economical, and scalable methods for preparing high-performance electrochromic materials and transparent electrode will endow electrochromic devices with integrated multiple functionalities and wider applications. Motivated by the benefits of electrochromic materials and devices for significant energy saving from reduced heating and cooling loads, the proposed project MAESDOSO aims to develop electrochromic devices for use in domestic ovens. The targeted device configuration will be entirely new in the home appliance market. Reduction of heat losses through glass of doors will be achieved by reflection of infrared radiation using low emissivity coatings on transparent conducting oxide.Integrating the current smart glass technology into the home appliance technology will contribute to reduce the cost of operation, increase the efficiency of the applied appliance and fulfill the aesthetic demands of the user.

According to recent analysis, the market for AM products is projected to grow annually by 18%. Although AM technologies are an integral part of digitized industrial production and of the 4th industrial revolution, Architectural, Engineering & Construction Industry (AECI) is reluctant to adopt them in design and construction. While AECI has been a pillar industry since 80's, its scale and impact on the global economy expands continuously. This development is also associated with important drawbacks, including large contribution to waste production, huge energy consumption and severe environmental pollution. The recent Green New Deal for Europe sets as primary objective the reform of heavy industry, including AECI, which accounts for 40% of the energy consumed on the continent. The main tools for achieving this objective are to minimize both materials used and amount of AECI waste. The principal aim of ADDOPTML network is to create and validate a holistic machine learning aided, optimum design-manufacturing process of civil structures by developing strong synergies among a multi-disciplinary team of academic experts and SMEs from Belgium, Cyprus, Germany, Greece, Italy, Jordan, Netherlands and Spain. This will be achieved taking advantage of ongoing progress in AM technologies including recycled consumables, thus contributing to the European challenge to become the world's first climate-neutral bloc by 2050.

These can be largely attributed to the lack of frameworks and tools able to effectively quantify interlinkages and feedbacks between nexus component and related ecosystems and to account for the effect of exogenous drivers of change (e.g. climate change). By combining ESs theories with complex system analysis, UNTWIST aims at contributing to fill these gaps demonstrating, through case studies applications, the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in developing integrated models supporting the quantification of critical interactions occurring in WEF nexus systems. Ecosystem Services (ESs) flows, being in the centre of the WEF relationships, will be used as common assessment endpoints to disentangle the nexus, thus contributing to reveal potential interdependencies between policy sectors and unlock opportunities for delivering integrated solutions addressing key challenges towards the achievement of interconnected Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The research project, which will last 24 months, will be mainly conducted at the Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3) in Bilbao (Spain), under the supervision of Professor Ferdinando Villa, while a secondment period, will be performed at GECOsistema (Italy), an environmental consulting based in Rimini.

However, the lack of well-developed technologies, has been main cause of slow acceptance of smart grids. This calls for the identification of unexplored research areas in smart grids. Positive outcomes of the research can help in laying down new and well-defined standards for the smart grids and associated intelligent technologies. A convenient and easily integrable product can also help in encouraging various distribution system operators to accept the new technologies. Massive amount of data is already being collected from the distribution networks using smart meters. Rapid advancements in machine learning research have opened up new avenues for data utilization in smart grid. Forerunners like DEPsys (a smart grid technology company based in Switzerland), have now simplified the distribution system data for further analysis and research. A critical concern raised by DEPsys customers, is their inability to trace the source of power quality issues in the distribution network, which in-turn leads to both energy and economic losses over time. This project builds up on existing infrastructure of DEPsys and aims to be an AMROUR (by improving robustness) for distribution networks against power quality events.

Unfortunately, the countries that are more exposed to seismic risk show also the highest percentage of building heritage older than 40 years, more than 75%, and ancient historical buildings, with no seismic aware design in place. In such countries, earthquakes are also accountable for countless death tolls.Quake Engineering proposes a distributed sensor network that is capable of automatically detect the occurrence of primary waves during a seismic event, and acting as a distributed IoT P2P neural network, propagate an alert to all the other nodes in the network in cascade. This “signaling” wave propagates much faster than the harmful secondary waves, providing the users with a local acoustic and visual alert, giving them a small time frame in the magnitude of tens of seconds for taking safety critical actions.The main purpose of the project is to carry an extensive demonstration of the effectiveness of the solution in a medium scale scenario, targeting the B2B and B2A markets as the most promising and eager early adopters.

In fact, marine primary production in many areas is now thought to be supported by organic P and Fe derived from prey. Despite  this, a consistent picture of the overall relevance of bacterivory in open ocean and coastal mixotrophic small phytoflagellates (MSP) is lacking. Additionally, a strict dichotomy between `phytoplankton´ and `zooplankton´ is still overwhelmingly employed in models predicting the flow of matter and energy through marine systems, leading to potentially flawed and misleading predictions on ecosystem productivity and the health of global fisheries. This is especially significant when considering that anticipated environmental changes related to climate change are expected to shift the phototrophy/mixotrophy balance, with largely unknown consequences. The present study will combine culture and field work to 1) determine how shifts in environmental conditions related to e.g. season, influence coastal MSP abundance, identity and bacterivorous impact on the whole prokaryotic community, and on specific prokaryotic groups, such as unicellular cyanobacteria; and 2) analyze the importance and basic regulation of bacterial uptake for understudied coastal MSP.

The buildings being built or renovated now, are the building stock of the future. Therefore, it is important to pay attention to the quality of work on construction site. Construction errors are responsible for most of poor energy performance of buildings in practice. Reasons for this are often lack of awareness of workers on construction sites making relevant parts of the building envelope or the HVAC systems regarding the complexity of nearly zero emission buildings. This is because of the very limited availability of further education in the construction sector in many countries around Europe especially with the focus on mutual recognition. Furthermore, actual offered courses in the building sector do not cover topics like cross craft understanding, lifelong service approaches, continuous controlling and monitoring or BIM-tools which are very important for the construction and maintenance of nZEBs. In addition, quality control also lacks in many cases.

Despite transistor scaling and improved architectures, modern supercomputers require kWs of power to replicate functionality for which living neural networks take only a few Ws. Currently there is no hardware that can provide a high synaptic density with reasonable energy consumption. Hybrid CMOS chips with stacked crossbars of analog non-volatile memory devices (NVM), like memristors, promise to deliver the required high density and connectivity. However, the crossbar architecture suffers from the sneak path problem, neighbouring devices creating electrical shorts around the selected device. Biological systems do not have this problem due to the inherent nonlinearity of their potentiation and spiking. A high nonlinearity can be reproduced in a crossbar by using a selector for each memory device. The selector commonly used is a transistor which limits the scalability and stackability. This project proposes an alternative selector based on a two-terminal MEMS switch. MEMS switches are heavily researched for RF applications, but their high nonlinearity makes them attractive as selectors for NVM. This project will design, simulate and fabricate a crossbar of integrated MEMS selectors and TiO2 memristor devices. Initially, the selectors and memristors will be optimized separately, then monolithically integrated. Their scalability and stackability will be investigated. Finally, a prototype 3x3 crossbar of integrated memristor/MEMS selectors will be fabricated and used to demonstrate vector matrix multiplication - a foundational element of many complex ANNs like a perceptron. The proposed work is not linked to a particular NVM (ReRAM is an example), being suitable for any dense crossbar system that requires selectors.

To do so, I will take advantage of a unique collection of syntrophic cultures obtained through extensive research. Firstly, I will unravel mechanisms used for aggregation by comparing the transcriptional profiles of syntrophic cultures and develop molecular analyses to quantify aggregating activities. The second part of the project will focus on development of a cultivation system and in-situ detection that will maintain the complex syntrophic interactions intact.

Mesocrystals have only very recently been described and are best viewed as an entirely new class of material. As such these unique substances have the potential to revolutionise materials/devices containing inorganic components. Applications are myriad and include building materials, such as concrete, with vastly greater compression strengths (in theory at least, the heights of concrete buildings could be increased from 500m to 15km!), solar cells with far higher solar harvesting efficiencies, new biomimetic materials, e.g. for use in joint replacement procedures, and electronic devices where size-dependent nanoparticle-like properties, e.g. superparamagnetism, are retained in macroscopic-sized materials enabling easier manufacture of components such as computer memory, quantum dot-based LEDs, etc. Currently approaches to mesocrystal formation are somewhat ad hoc and these kinds of application remain largely unachievable. The principle underlying reason for this is that mesocrystal formation processes are often still too poorly understood. POLYCOMP will remove this bottleneck to mesocrystal exploitation by focusing directly on developing a generic understanding of mesocrystal formation processes.

It has been necessary to do this as the population of the earth shares the same 35 million km3 out of the 1.4 billion km3 water there is. Yet, this raise a new problem as the fossil fuel emits pollutants and speeds up climate change which in turn makes the water shortage problem even worse as it results in higher temperatures and droughts. Solar Water Plc has found another solution. In a laboratory it has been researched and tested that it is possible to use solar power to produce fresh water, suitable for drinking. The laboratory model can now be turned into a real world prototype; Field Demonstrator Model.

About 130 million tons of herbicides per year are used in Europe alone that persist in the environment, destroy non-target plants and beneficial insects for the soil and produce health effects in animals and humans –cancer, birth defects and endocrine disruption. Moreover, existing herbicides become more and more ineffective due to the evolution and spread of herbicide-resistant weeds. Substitution of herbicides by mechanical automatic systems is under study, but mechanical solutions contribute to deteriorate the soil properties, harm beneficial soil organisms and provide poor results for in-row weeding.WeLASER solution focuses on non-chemical weed management based on applying lethal doses of energy on the weed meristems using a high-power laser source. An AI-vision system discriminates crops from weeds and detects the position of the weed meristems to point the laser on them using a laser scanner. An autonomous vehicle carries these systems all over the field. A smart controller coordinates these systems and uses IoT and cloud computing techniques to manage agricultural knowledge. This technology will provide a clean solution to the weeding problem and will help to decrease significantly the chemicals on the environment. The required technologies for building this system and the number of actors needed to push it close to market demands the participation of ten experienced groups not easily found at the national level. Moreover, the cost of this high-technological equipment exceeds the funding levels of national organizations and claims the collaboration of large governmental institutions. Thus, with the EC help, WeLASER will put to work a large group of actors and stakeholders to advance in achieving the demanded productivity in agriculture while making the environment more sustainable and enhancing health to animals and humans.",2020-10-01,2023-09-30,36.0,SIGNED,4999393.0,5470660.0,['energy'],,"['building', 'smart']",2
22492,ALARTE,Remote long-term monitoring of critical infrastructure with key safety movement band tolerance in landslide vulnerable areas,958701,"Monitoring slope movements is becoming a crucial task in today’s societies. Natural landslides cause damages of €18 billion/year at a global scale, and around 66M people—1% of the world’s population—currently live in high-risk areas. Furthermore, this number is increasing steadily due to climate change. On the other hand, human activities such as large geotechnical constructions, a growing network of linear infrastructures and mining increase the danger of soil movement. The need for cost-effective and reliable slope monitoring technology is increasing. However, currently available slope monitoring technologies are basically reduced to manual inclinometer probes, which require the deployment of operators and equipment to take measures directly in the slope. This hampers measurements at short intervals or in remote or unstable areas. Automatic inclinometers are capable of transmitting data in real time, however they are very costly and require complex technical installations. We present ALARTE: an automatic inclinometer probe that can transmit data in real, is cost-effective and easily installed; a game-changing technology that will disrupt the market of geotechnical monitoring by closing the gap between manual and automatic monitoring options. The consortium is composed by companies covering the whole supply chain: Tecnalia (Spain), IPR and R&D, Mikrosay (Turkey) production, FEHRL (Belgium) dissemination, Sixense (France) commercialization and Ferrovial (Spain) validation. We will target monitoring service companies, geotechnical consultants, critical infrastructure operators, and the Public administration putting the focus on growing infrastructure markets: linear, energy, mining and urban engineering. We plan sale at least 3,078 ALARTE units and sign 574 monitoring service contracts.

It will develop a smart and flexible, small-scale CHP unit (100-1,000 kWe) fueled with fast pyrolysis bio-oil originating from different types of biomasses and/or residues. Fast pyrolysis converts biomass into a uniform liquid intermediate called FPBO, and the process is characterized by a high feedstock flexibility. Nowadays, FPBO is produced on commercial scale in Europe. For small scale biomass CHP systems a standardized fuel, enabling optimization of the conversion units and thus creating a cost competitive value chain, is highly preferred. Moreover, to achieve high resource efficiencies at all times a highly flexible ratio between heat and power generation is desired. A smart, demand driven unit should be capable of dealing with the fluctuating energy demand and/or varying availability of wind/solar power. The SmartCHP system combines a FPBO fueled engine and flue gas boiler to produce electricity and heat at a high efficiency over the whole load range. A dedicated flue gas treatment guarantees low emissions. Moreover, a wide, adjustable heat-to-power ratio is covered which enables to respond directly to actual energy demands. The final result of SmartCHP is an integrated system consisting of an engine, boiler and flue gas treatment system adapted and optimized to run on FPBO (TRL 5). A real-time, predictive, dynamic model will be developed to find the optimal operation point at all energy demands. Techno-economic, socio-economic and environmental assessments will be performed to identify real market opportunities. The SmartCHP unit will be based on standard diesel engines, and specific investment costs are expected to be around 1,200 Eur/kWe; an electricity price below 0.10 Eur/kWh is realistic.

At the same time, decentralized production presents advantages as heat is not wasted and there is no loss in the electricity transportation. Integrated into smart grids, decentralized productions increases the global efficiency of the energy production. FLAMINCO is an ultra-efficient gas heat pump consisting of an innovative micro combined heat and power –micro CHP- unit, a state-of-the-art heat pump and a condensing water boiler. It may be powered with natural gas, biogas or H2 and gas mixtures. It provides up to 135 kWth. A smart control system makes the three involved technologies always work in the most cost-efficient way, ending with a yearly average efficiency of 160%. This system is ready for integration into smart grids and considers temporary costs and carbon intensity of electricity to decide the working mode. FLAMINCO targets 15-20 apartment buildings. End-users may reduce gas use by 30%, what immediately translates into economic savings (4,600 €/yr) and CO2 reduction with a fast payback of just 4 years.

No one likes an autonomous car that is doomed to a collision accident once every few years or months. In the real world, collision does happen at every second - more than 1.3 million people are killed by road accidents every single year. The current approaches for vehicle collision detection such as vehicle to vehicle communication, radar, laser based Lidar and GPS are far from acceptable in terms of reliability, cost, energy consumption and size. For example, radar is too sensitive to metallic material, Lidar is too expensive and it does not work well on absorbing/reflective surfaces, GPS based methods are difficult in cities with high buildings, vehicle to vehicle communication cannot detect pedestrians or any objects unconnected, segmentation based vision methods are too computing power thirsty to be miniaturized, and normal vision sensors cannot cope with fog, rain and dim environment at night. To save people’s lives and to make autonomous vehicles safer to serve human society, a new type of trustworthy, robust, low cost, and low energy consumption vehicle collision detection and avoidance systems are badly needed.This consortium proposes an innovative solution with brain-inspired multiple layered and multiple modalities information processing for trustworthy vehicle collision detection.

Following the recent International Climate Change conference in Paris, many nations have initiated measures to fulfill their agreements to reduce carbon emissions and promote renewable energy. In addition, EU Horizon 2020 has the major priority to invest funds in development of secure, clean and efficient energy methods. Currently, the most efficient way to produce the clean energy source H2 requires platinum. However, this metal is highly scarce and expensive. Carbon Dioxide conversion to synthetic fuels such as CO, formaldehyde is likewise mainly performed by expensive metals, and at high temperatures which are unsustainable. Therefore, there is a strong incentive to develop alternative, sustainable catalysts based on cheap, earth-abundant materials. In this project, we are going to use the diamonds as nano materials which can release electrons into solution upon illumination; the electrons can be used by the transition metal complexes for the production of hydrogen and to convert CO2 into valuable chemicals such as CO, formic acid. The inspiration comes here from the natures photosynthesis where the sunlight is harvested by plants to fix CO2 to valuable chemicals such as carbohydrates. Diamond is unique in its ability to produce solvated electrons directly into solution upon irradiation; these electrons are highly reducing and have capacity to activate CO2. This projects aims to improve the selectivity and efficiency of the reduction process by coupling the reducing electrons from diamond with the most effective transition metal catalysts from literature.

The RICAS2020 Design Study for the European Underground Research Infrastructure related to Advanced Adiabatic Compressed Air Energy Storage (AA-CAES) will provide concepts to set-up a research infrastructure dedicated to underground storage of very high amounts of green energy. The big advantage of the new concepts will be that the underground energy storage can be performed independently from the encountered geological conditions and also at all places where high energy demand exists. AA-CAES collects the heat produced by compression and returns it to the air when the air is expanded to generate power and thus delivers higher efficiencies via a zero-carbon process.

Yet, large populations of microorganisms are found in buried sediments, living in a state of strongly reduced metabolic activity. The evolutionary advantages of survival in this dormancy-like state remain unclear and may be related to rare events where buried microorganisms are returned to energy-replete conditions after centuries or millennia of starvation.The aim of this project is to observe how fast different sediment-inhabiting microbes are able to reactivate their metabolism and resume growth, and to determine the physiological changes and molecular mechanisms associated with the process. To initiate reactivation of starved microorganisms in a natural setting, deep layers of lake sediment will be transplanted to energy-rich surface sediments in diffusion chambers allowing nutrients to enter the chamber while preventing invasion of other microbes. Changes in gene expression of individual populations, combined with monitoring of cell size, shape, and biomass production will reveal molecular, physiological, and morphological responses involved in exiting starvation. The hypotheses on preferential substrate utilization and interdependencies between different populations derived from results of this in-situ experiment will be tested in controlled laboratory experiments, where targeted reactivation of selected community members will be triggered by addition of predicted preferred substrate.The uncovered mechanisms of microbial starvation survival and reactivation will have implications for the carbon cycling performed by sediment microbial communities, an essential part of the global cycle of carbon sequestration and remineralization.

This makes concrete the affordable, universal and irreplaceable construction material. Cement works as the glue that binds the concrete’s aggregates together. However, while cement has shaped much of our cities and infrastructures, it also has a massive carbon footprint. The actual chemical process of making cement emits staggeringly high levels of CO2 and is the source of 8% of the world's CO2 emissions. The bigger challenge and opportunity lie in tweaking the recipe for cement, such that the process does not produce as much CO2. ngCon additive innovation is key to formulate new classes of sustainable cements capable of tuning the bulk physical properties of concrete during preparation and improving its performance. ngCon additive drastically improves the compressive strength of concrete up to 50%.

The pace at which data are generated by scientific experiments and large simulations (e.g., multiphysics, climate, weather forecast, etc.) poses new challenges in terms of capability of efficiently and effectively analysing massive data sets. Artificial Intelligence, and more specifically Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) recently gained momentum for boosting simulations’ speed. ML/DL techniques are part of simulation processes, used to early detect patterns of interests from less accurate simulation results.  To address these challenges, the ACROSS project will co-design and develop an HPC, BD, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) convergent platform, supporting applications in the Aeronautics, Climate and Weather, and Energy domains. To this end, ACROSS will leverage on next generation of pre-exascale infrastructures, still being ready for exascale systems, and on effective mechanisms to easily describe and manage complex workflows in these three domains. Energy efficiency will be achieved by massive use of specialized hardware accelerators, monitoring running systems and applying smart mechanisms of scheduling jobs. ACROSS will combine traditional HPC techniques with AI (specifically ML/DL) and BD analytic techniques to enhance the application test case outcomes (e.g., improve the existing operational system for global numerical weather prediction, climate simulations, develop an environment for user-defined in-situ data processing, improve and innovate the existing turbine aero design system, speed up the design process, etc.).

Current ELS power supply circuits force lights to remain on for long hours when not needed: when power is turned off manually, existing circuits keep ELS on (powered by batteries). This leads to needless energy consumption and fast battery deterioration. We, at Uni-light LED, have developed Smartunnel, a new smart LED ELS for tunnels under construction/refurbishment, which turns off when light is not needed. Our smart switch and intelligent control allow discrimination between unintentional power outage and intentional interruption, so that emergency lights are lit only under the first scenario. This prevents excessive battery exhaustion/recharging cycles thus making Smartunnel the longest-life ELS on the market (10 years, 80% reduction in battery waste). Smartunnel offers 20-30% increased energy efficiency leading to effective savings of €13,000/3km per year. Our flicker-free and electromagnetic interference-free lights improve visibility and reduce health issues, enhancing safety and security for tunnel workers. Conveniently, Smartunnel can use existing wiring installations to power emergency lights, curbing the cost of new wiring in existing tunnels. We already commercialise 7 lighting product types, based on our patented LED light Driver and Thermal Management Technology for illumination in agriculture, industry and on ships, thus far reaching 100 companies in the UK, Sweden, Germany and Austria.

24845,Lt-AD,Low-temperature anaerobic digestion treatment of low-strength wastewaters,650515,"NVP Energy presents the first to market, high-rate anaerobic digestion (AD) technology that successfully treats low strength wastewater (WW) at ambient temperatures (< 20°C). The low-temperature (Lt-AD) process provides a novel solution to Food and Drinks industrial sectors producing large WW volumes requiring treatment. The sector of interest is milk treatment and processing, a growing market producing over 367 billion litres annually; WW is typically treated using conventional aerobic processes resulting in high sludge yields, requiring a large footprint on-site and a heavy reliance on fossil fuels. Lt-AD produces negligible sludge volumes, has a compact design, requires no heat input or biogas recirculation, and produces effluent of urban wastewater directive (UWWD) standard (< 125 mg/L COD) without post-aeration. A typical dairy processing plant producing 5,000 m3 WW per day can save 97% on operational costs by replacing aerobic treatment with Lt-AD, and generate annual biogas revenue of €616,266. The technology's low temperature operation allows for 100% of the biogas produced being available for reuse or resale. The process also has a high impact on environmental savings through reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, lowered thermal energy and fossil fuels requirements. This feasibility study will allow NVP Energy to build relationships with potential users, assess EU market opportunities, and determine resources required to deliver a full WW treatment solution in terms of technical, legal, environmental, marketing, sales, manufacturing or service capabilities. The outcomes will be the securing of a demonstrator industrial site, achieving an in-depth understanding of the EU market, building concrete relationships with collaborators and ultimately producing an all-embracing business plan. Phase 2 delivery of Lt-AD as a full-scale treatment solution for low strength WW producers will be critical to delivering this technology throughout Europe and beyond.",2014-11-01,2015-04-30,6.0,CLOSED,50000.0,71429.0,['energy'],,"['building', 'urban']",2

This new solution has been inspired by the skyscraper’s building methodology.As a consequence of the development of this new crane, the second objective will be the introduction in the market of a new full-concrete tower with no height limit and with a new patented procedure of building that will bring reliability, time saving, quality and workers safety.In the current decade the main trend in the wind energy sector is to decrease the costs of the energy produced by wind turbines. One of the main strategies is the installation of the rotor axis (as well as nacelle and generator) at higher heights, as much as possible, where turbulences are minor and the efficiency of the equipment is higher. However, the wind industry has found some technical and economic constraints given by the construction of steel towers. This constraints are related to: size limitations in transport (larger diameters of tower segments), cost increase for heights greater than 100m., vibrations, etc..Full concrete towers, built with precast concrete elements are a feasible solution: easy to transport, more durable (~50 years vs. ~25 years of steel), less vibrant, less required maintenance, etc. Another advantage is that concrete annual average price is significantly lower than steel.The development of the new AIRCRANE will help in the construction of full concrete towers, to reach heights unreachable with conventional nowadays crawler cranes (>140m) and at a much lower cost.",2015-05-01,2015-10-31,6.0,CLOSED,50000.0,71429.0,['energy'],,"['building', 'buildings']",2

The main objective of the FIBREGY project is to enable the extensive use of FRP materials in the structure of the next generation of large Renewable Energy Offshore Platforms (REOPs) by overcoming the above mentioned challenges. In order to achieve this objective, the project will develop, qualify and audit innovative FRP materials for offshore applications, elaborate new design procedures and guidelines, generate efficient production, inspection and monitoring methodologies, and validate and demonstrate advanced software analysis tools. Clear performance indicators will be designed and applied in the evaluation of two existing REOPs concepts to be re-engineered in FRP in the project. Finally, the different technologies generated in FIBREGY will be demonstrated by using advanced simulation techniques and building a real-scale prototype to validate the materials, tools, solutions, procedures and guidelines to be developed in FIBREGY.",2021-01-01,2023-12-31,36.0,SIGNED,6499589.75,8056482.5,['energy'],['energy'],"['building', 'climate']",2
25478,cs-BIPV-FS,Next-generation transparent PV for Building Integrated Photovoltaics,887915,"Roughly 40% of the current global energy demand is consumed in commercial and residential buildings. Thanks to advances in technology, Building Integrated PhotoVoltaics (BIPV) have emerged, enabling all buildings to become electricity producers and strive towards self-sustainability. Due to stringent energy efficiency norms in the EU, demand for BIPV products is soaring: PV incorporated in shells of multi-story buildings is required for supplying these high rise structures with energy. But also other artificial structures, e.g. sound barriers along highways, shall be used for energy provision, without further impact on the environment. Yet, truly integrated and aesthetic BIPV modules are currently neither available in commercial volumes nor at sustainable costs. Prices of products with still limited adaptability hinder the actual market growth. crystalsol addresses these shortcomings with a patented and entirely new type of cost-efficient, flexible and transparent PV technology where advantages of an efficient and stable monocrystalline absorber and low cost roll-to-roll (R2R) module production are combined. Due to the reason that crystalsol is able to produce semi-finished modules that allow full integration into building elements without any expensive and complex integration steps, BIPV products can pricewise finally compete with standard building shell elements (like facades without PV). This offers a huge competitive advantage, resulting in an enormous potential in the BIPV market. This Feasibility Study (cs-BIPV-FS) will bring crystalsol closer to the market entry stage. It will be a first step towards full commercialisation before upscaling the company’s operations and production processes. The cs-BIPV-FS project will help to analyse and conclude the technical feasibility and commercial potential of the ground-breaking BIPV technology, resulting in advancing the innovative technological concept into a credible business case.",2019-11-01,2020-01-31,3.0,CLOSED,50000.0,71429.0,['energy'],,"['building', 'energy demand', 'buildings']",3

The principal duty of the bacteria in the mammalian gut is the fermentation of undigested dietary components, which results in the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and H2 gas. The H2 produced by fermentation has to be disposed of very efficiently, since the buildup of H2 strongly disrupts gut function. The harmful accumulation of H2 is prevented by three groups of H2-consuming microbes - sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), acetogens, and methanogens. Thus, H2 is a critical metabolite in the gut that controls colonic fermentation and the flow of energy and carbon to the host. Yet, we do not understand the identity of the major functional producers/consumers of H2, the ecological forces that drive one or more of the H2-consuming guilds to colonize the gut, or the microbe-microbe interactions between fermenters and H2-consumers that lead to efficient H2 dispersal. The objectives of the proposed research program are to 1) determine what pathways for H2 production and consumption are actively expressed in the gut using a mouse model, 2) elucidate the identity and spatial distribution of hydrogen producers/consumers in the mouse gut at the single cell level, and 3) ) elucidate the physiological mechanisms of H2 transfer in the gut using model communities. Overall, these research actions will produce the first characterization of the microbiota community members that actively influence the hydrogen economy in the gut in-situ and how these microbe-microbe interactions control colonic fermentation.",2018-09-01,2020-08-31,24.0,CLOSED,178156.8,178156.8,['energy'],,"['communities', 'community']",2

As stated above this project has a big target market. Around 4.5 million lifts are currently installed in the EU. The remaining 3.2 million are medium-use elevators (found in our target residential sector) where the innovation proposed could be disruptive. This means that the new development has a target market of about 2.1M lifts in Europe. This includes only the existing lifts. According from the Elevator World Magazine, 12,000 new electric lifts were installed in Europe, representing a 10.7% increase on 2011. Although we are targeting Europe first with our technology, we believe this technology could also be marketed at the international market.   Our overall objective for Phase 1 is to create a Feasibility Study that consists of a technological feasibility, market assessment, business model assessment, risk assessment, IPR assessment and a Business Plan. If the result of the Feasibility Study is positive, we will apply to Phase 2.",2015-05-01,2015-07-31,3.0,CLOSED,50000.0,71429.0,['energy'],['energy'],"['smart', 'buildings', 'positive']",3

The outcomes of the project will allow in the short term to reinforce the competitiveness of this new low carbon energy technology and therefore to favour its integration in the European energy mix.The technology consists of a solar-driven micro gas-turbine as top cycle and an Organic Rankine Cycle as bottom cycle. There is no water requirement for cooling. A thermal energy storage is integrated between both cycles. The resulting power block is a solar power generation system able to meet the requirements of a local variable demand of energy with a high average conversion efficiency of 18% and a low environmental profile with an investment cost target below 5 €/W. Besides electricity generation, other applications will be considered for future developments, such as heating/cooling of multi-family buildings or water desalination for small communities.The project will build a 60 kW prototype plant with a 2 MWh thermal storage unit and will validate this innovative power cycle in a relevant environment (TRL 5), assess its technical, economic and environmental performances and establish the guidelines for its commercial deployment. POLYPHEM will lead to a supply price of electricity of 21 c€/kWh under DNI of 2050 kWh/m2/year, thus meeting for small scale CSP plants the 40% cost reduction of the SET Plan. POLYPHEM will be carried out by 4 research centers and 5 private  companies. The project makes a step forward beyond the state-of-the-art of thermodynamic cycles in CSP plants. The micro gas-turbine will be solarized to integrate solar energy in the cycle.

This transition calls for an annual investment of 2–4 trillion USD, which is a multiple of current climate investment. Accordingly, the EU and many countries are enacting green financial policies, intervening in the financial sector to improve financing conditions for low-carbon technologies. Examples include green state investment banks, carbon disclosure requirements, and changes to lending regulations. However, the effect of these financial policies on investments in non-financial sectors such as energy, transport, or building is largely unknown. More specifically, we lack insights on how different low-carbon technologies require different types of finance (such as public vs. private finance, corporate vs. project finance, or equity vs. debt). Hence, it remains unclear how to make best use of such policies to fill the climate finance gap. By bridging disciplines and using novel data, GREENFIN will lead to a breakthrough in our understanding of the effects of financial policies on the low-carbon transition in non-financial sectors, and thereby lay the foundations for a new interdisciplinary field of financial policy analysis. First, combining theory from technology innovation studies and financial economics, I will derive how technology-inherent characteristics predict the demand for different types of finance. Second, using policy analysis tools and novel machine learning-based methods, I will analyze the effects of green financial policies on the supply of various types of finance. Third, combining these insights I will deliver specific recommendations for designing more effective green financial policies in the EU and beyond.

Communities have found different ways of getting together to fight energy poverty. Solidarity is the cornerstone of all these initiatives which have huge potential for replication. Renewable energy cooperatives (RESCOOPs) are the most democratic and oldest form of energy community: groups of citizens that get together in a democratic manner to achieve energy resilience, independence and sustainable energy generation and use.The CEES project identifies and analyses the most successful cases of community energy initiatives to tackle energy poverty in Europe, validates them academically and empirically, supports the overcoming of regulatory and financial barriers, and then creates a toolkit for EU replication through RESCOOPs network of +3000 energy communities, a formula which has proven very successful in the past. CEES will facilitate the adoption of behavioural and energy efficiency measures in households, create financial and non-financial support schemes to address energy poverty and empower community leaders (and organizations working in adjacent areas such as financial advice, health care or even fire and police services) to identify and deal with energy poverty, establishing quick and responsive networks.

The scientific objectives of the projects aim at obtaining high added value chemicals from biomass. This will be done using a subproduct of biorefinery processes, formic acid, as hydrogen source to transform two key biomass derivative molecules, succinic acid and furfural into gamma-butyrolactone and furfuryl alcohol, that can be used as building block to produce chemicals for the pharmaceutical industry. By doing so, we avoid the use of hydrogen from fossil fuels. Since, formic acid decomposition results also in CO2. we also aim at obtaining cost-effective catalysts for the so-called automethanation, a reaction in which by adding oxygen the yield to methane is enhanced and that can be used in any process to convert CO2. The study of the reactions mechanisms will be also pursued to optimize the processes and expand the knowledge in this area to be useful for related transformations.

In this respect, PHOENIX aims to develop and deliver a disruptive electrochemical reactor combining hydrogen production and plastic waste recycling. Hydrogen has manifold applications i.e., fuel, energy vector and chemical feedstock, and polymer synthesis is prevalent, 260 Mtons synthesised just in 2019 and no drastic reduction in near-term projections. Clearly, a suitable portfolio of novel and scalable technologies is urgently needed to process both commodities (hydrogen & plastics) in a sustainable way. Whence, ramping up the production of green hydrogen, i.e., renewables-derived, perfectly intertwines with the need to boost the whole volume of recycled plastic which currently amounts to only 15% of the total plastic in circulation.

Solar panels enable energy savings; typically installed on the roof, but they do not offer versatility for other type of application, such as windows to allow the entrance of the light inside buildings or greenhouses.Our company has developed PanePower Solar Window (SW). PanePowerSW is a unique transparent (up to 70%) solar panel glass that generates clean energy through PV technology and more importantly allows the light to shine through greenhouses and commercial buildings windows. PanePowerSW contributes to the energy savings in buildings up to 30%, while in greenhouses, it enables the growing of the crop while reducing energy costs, quantified in 25% of the total operational costs. Thanks to Phase II project, we expect to reach the market in 2020, gaining sales of at least 20,000m2 in China and The Netherlands.

26761,FuturePowerFlow,Exploiting the full integration potential of fluctuating renewable energies in power grid operation by new predictive technologies,947129,"Over the past years, a lot of (political) initiatives led to rising numbers of decentralized renewable energy generators like wind parks and solar plants, even on rooftops of private households. Although this tendency is very positive concerning the targeted energy transition and for reaching the EU’s valuable 2030 climate and energy goals, the thousands of different decentralized power supply units connected in different parts of the grid, at different voltage levels and under different grid code standards challenge grid operators. The volatility of renewable energy generation (caused by weather conditions) and the need to balance power generation and demand within grids head to an oxymoron: although wind blows and sun shines, grid operators have to reactively curtail these plants from the grid to guarantee grid safety. Current control room systems are not made for a proactive and exact management and control of single assets  – limiting the share of renewable energies in our power mix to a lower level than it’s possible. To fully exploit the potential of clean and green energy by 100%, energy & meteo systems developed FuturePowerFlow, an algorithm-based, modular system which uses weather forecasts, locations of renewable energy plants, data on grid infrastructure, historic demand data and even operating status of plants (iced, under maintenance, etc) to predict power flows in the grid based on generation and consumption for the next 48h in very high time-resolution. Instead of reacting just demand driven, FuturePowerFlow enables grid operators for the first time ever to proactively plan and manage the integration of decentralized renewable assets into their grid and execute precise actions within one system.FuturePowerFlow targets on a EUR 2.6bn energy market and is the perfect solution for transmission system operators and distribution system operators to manage their grids efficiently, directly targeting at and fulfilling their user needs.",2020-03-01,2022-02-28,24.0,SIGNED,1682625.0,2403750.0,['energy'],,"['positive', 'climate']",2

The nexus has gained particular importance in terms of vulnerability to natural hazards since these can negatively affect the long-term availability of resources and pose a major risk to resource security. Building long-term resilience to resource insecurity requires interconnected solutions that also take account of particularly vulnerable groups such as youth. NEXUS-DRR offers a novel and interconnected approach by linking nexus thinking with disaster risk reduction. This MSCGF investigates threats to the food-water-energy nexus from the perspective of local knowledge and social practices of Brazilian youth in marginalized communities that are affected by environmental hazards such as floods and landslides. Using participatory research methods such as citizen science, it explores young people’s everyday lived experiences and practices related to the nexus. It investigates their understanding of the nexus, their access to and their use of resources as well as their knowledge of the causes of nexus threats and future scenarios. Moreover, it explores the social practices that young people have adopted to reduce their vulnerability in terms of resource insecurity, and investigates how youth knowledge and their social practices can be valued for the development of public policies. Through joint supervision, mentoring, career and interdisciplinary skills development at the beneficiary, the University of Birmingham (UK), and the host university, the University of Sao Paulo (Brazil), this MSCGF significantly strengthens the Fellow’s profile and career opportunities as an internationally recognised researcher of excellence in applied nexus, resilience, and environmental youth research.",2019-08-05,2023-02-10,42.0,SIGNED,270327.36,270327.36,['energy'],,"['building', 'communities']",2

However, currently the installation of SOFC is difficult to design and run in an economically convenient way, due to the difficulty in predicting and optimizing the capacity utilization factor, i.e. the number of hours the m-CHP is operating, which depends on the fluctuating and seasonal heating demand of the application.SOLUTION: EGG1 is a patented configuration which combines SOFC with electric driven Heat Pump (HP) and an innovative control system able to optimize and make profitable the application of SOFC for residential and small commercial applications, by decoupling the heat and electricity production from the user demands, so making it able to respond to the electricity price signals or demand/response in smart grid configurations. EGG1 supplies power and heating demands using natural gas without any combustion, thus without any harmful smog and PM emission into the atmosphere, maximizing the capacity utilization factor and making SOFC and HP become economically profitable even in very cold climates, thanks to reduction of the energy bill of >50%. Egg integrates and sells the EGG1 micro-CHP as a black box for up to 10 apartments block, integrating BlueGEN 1.5 kW SOFC under partnership agreement with SOLIDpower, the world’s most advanced producer of SOFC m-CHP.

Therefore, it is important to develop new energy efficient, smart functional materials in order to meet society’s future energy demands. Functional hollow fibers with smart characteristics (such as self-regulated heating and regeneration of the adsorbent bed) have the potential to meet these challenges, and compact systems could be formed that also exhibit low pressure drop, no adsorbent bed settling and channelling, and have a low thermal mass for rapid regeneration of the adsorbent layer. The novel hollow fiber will consist of a thin film zeolite inner layer for adsorption of target species, while the outer layer is formed from a perovskite-type Lanthanum doped BaTiO3 ceramic with positive temperature coefficient of resistance (PTCR) characteristics. The PTCR layer provides inherent temperature control, imparting self-regulating and self-limited Ohmic (Joule) heating with thermal energy directed onto the inner adsorbent layer in order to regenerate the system for the next process cycle.

EU is encouraging the reduction of fossil fuels towards the adoption of renewable energy as a resource. All new buildings are required to be nearly zero energy balance by the end of 2020.Currently, the solar industry is limited to a utility scale central power generation model. A highly differentiated product is required to disrupt this model and provide accessible solar power for the residential market. The EU is currently installing less than 100,000 residential solar roofs per year; this needs to increase to 3,000,000 per year to avoid worst scenario climate change. Current solar roofs use large utility scale panels and often complex installation; it is a very capital intensive process. Energyntegration technology preserves and improves aesthetics of the buildings whilst minimising installing costs for the property owners. The product series is based on a moulded aluminium frame that can be painted in the desired colour and covered with a front glass with low adsorption and transparent solar quality. The tile is easily installed onto roofs without any truss modification. The integration with the existing roof is complete, as the tile matches perfectly slope, level and colour of every type of roof, thus enabling the installation also in areas with historical or landscape restrictions. The panel produces electricity by solar conversion while the heat sink cool down the PV temperature while also exploiting the ‘waste’ heat productively, thus increasing the efficiency of the single tile. HyTile targets the residential and re-roofing markets to promote the development of Net Zero Energy Homes.The Phase 1 project will be focused on establishing a complete supply chain, a sound business model and commercialization strategy and to plan all activities for deploying a pilot installation in three historical cities.",2016-03-01,2016-06-30,4.0,CLOSED,50000.0,71429.0,['energy'],,"['cities', 'building', 'climate', 'buildings', 'net zero']",5

While delivering many benefits, the current plastics economy has drawbacks that are becoming more apparent by the day. The primary problem is the high material waste rate and poor closed-loop recycling in plastics manufacturing. Today, just 14% of plastics are used for recycling. To cope this problem, the European Commission has tried to implement increasingly stringent regulations, such as reducing landfilling or incineration, by increasing the taxes for waste disposal and promoting recycling. Nevertheless, the current inefficient recycling technologies make plastics recycled uncompetitive as raw material for many plastics converters. At TUSTI. BV. (Eindhoven, Netherlands) we have developed a smart solution to overcome these barriers. EGREMPLARE high-tech recycling process is a novel process that makes recycling of mixed plastics possible, allowing to increase to 60-85% the collected plastics to be recycled. We use our proprietary cleaning process that uses a bio-based material without not generation of new waste streams and with a low energy consumption. Companies have to pay less than landfilling taxes, contributing to the achievement of objectives set by the European Commission and reducing disposal cost. Since our foundation in 2015, we have invested over 350,000 euros to develop pilots tests, the bio-based cleaner, and process improvements. Now, based on the good results of our system, we aim to speed-up the technology to introduce our solution in the plastic recycled market. This market with such growth potential (predicted to increase at 6% CAGR up to 2022 reaching €42B), could greatly benefit from our eco-friendly and low-energy solution.

However, urban dimensions are absent from models projecting global energy and emissions by country and sector. This omission underrepresents the significant connection between urban dynamics and future emission trajectories, and hinders identification of integrated planning strategies for maximum emission reductions. The main objective of SUFFICCS is to develop and demonstrate a framework for integrated modelling of service levels (m2 floorspace, passenger-km), energy demand, and emissions from urban buildings and transport systems. This modelling framework will be developed using data from urban regions of European countries, and designed for integration with a global dynamic material flow analysis model. Emissions from producing new buildings, infrastructure, and transport equipment will be included, enabling a comprehensive assessment of climate change impacts and mitigation potential of future urbanisation. The incorporation of urban dynamics into energy and climate models, and the linking of transport and buildings sectors through joint dependencies on urban form will represent major advancements in modelling capabilities. These advancements will facilitate assessment of urban and national emission trajectories under various scenarios of urban form, with unprecedented integration of buildings and transport sectors.

To achieve ultra-low energy dispersion rates, INVISIBLE WINDOW eliminates the frame around the edge of the glass (the part most dispersive and prone to wear), significantly reducing its size, and places it between the two panes of the IGU. In this way, the low-profile frame cooperates structurally with the glass; all this owing to a joint made with high-performance structural adhesives, mainly used in the nautical and aeronautical sectors. The low-profile frame can be made of aluminium with a thermal break, wood or of GFRP (composite materials with high mechanical properties).

Especially in the case of customised products which are unsuitable for testing in laboratories. There is a lack of expertise, experience, and resources available across Europe for such kind of testing. An increasing concern is that new regulations addressing these products risk being unenforceable. The aim of the INTAS project is to address these concerns and provide technical and cooperative support, as well as capacity building activities, to MSAs charged with enforcing these regulations. The need for the INTAS project arises from the difficulty that MSAs and market actors face in establishing and verifying compliance with energy performance requirements for large industrial products subject to requirements of the Ecodesign Directive. The focus of the project is to support compliance for very large industrial products, specifically transformers and industrial fans, with the requirements of the Ecodesign Directive. The energy consumption of transformers and industrial fans is very significant and thus the risk of losses due to poor compliance cannot be ignored. The project aims to:a. support European Member State MSAs deliver compliance for large products (specifically for transformers and large fans); b. support industry to be sure of what their obligations are under the Ecodesign Directive and to deliver compliance in a manner that will be broadly accepted by MSAs; c. foster a common European approach to the delivery and verification of compliance for these products.The INTAS project involves 16 partners among them  there are 11 organisations, which are National MSAs or cooperating closely with the National MSAs, targeting 10 European countries (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Italy).",2016-03-01,2019-02-28,36.0,CLOSED,1880448.0,1906966.25,['energy'],,"['building', 'energy consumption']",2

Thus, I aim to use fundamental insights to offer energy-efficient solutions for undesirable ice formation and promoting dropwise condensation using novel and robust nanoengineered surfaces. My objectives are: i) to realise thermodynamically guided metallic surfaces with precise (<10 nm) morphology and controlled superficial stiffness for energy-efficient icing prevention and sustaining dropwise flow condensationii) to rationally intercalate polymers and/or suspensions into surface nanotextures and exploit nanomechanics in order to enable robust and smart nanoengineered surfaces for high speed impact, abrasion and chemical resistance; stable icephobicity (delaying freezing); and sustained dropwise condensation.iii) to develop new fundamental insights to: a) prevent icing due to high speed (~100 m/s) supercooled droplet/ice crystal impact; b) realise icephobicity down to -30 degrees Celsius; c) minimise ice-surface adhesion; and d) sustain dropwise condensation at high (50-100 m/s) vapour speeds.  The proposal emphasis on energy efficiency is aligned with the EU's 20/20/20 Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan. To exemplify their salient impact, the proposed smart nanoengineered surfaces offer a passive solution for airplane icing (and related accidents) and will delay evaporator icing on air source heat pumps and refrigerators, thereby helping to lower the energy use in buildings and cold storages.

Alleviation of the structural damage and reducing collapse risk under sever ground motions has been a general research focus in earthquake engineering. However, earthquake reconnaissance reports also foreground the significance of injuries, fatalities and economical losses due to failure of non-structural components. Furthermore, the functionality of some critical buildings carrying acceleration-sensitive equipment such as hospitals can be interrupted due to non-structural damage after a seismic event. Therefore, it is vital to urgently meet an inevitable social demand for truly resilient construction. In target resilient buildings, both structural and non-structural damage should be minimized simultaneously in order to mitigate direct and indirect losses such as repair costs and costly downtime during which the building cannot be used or occupied. Different strategies have been implemented by researchers to mitigate the structural and non-structural damage. As an instance, self-centering frames have been developed with the aim of avoiding residual drifts after a seismic event. Meanwhile, hybrid steel-concrete frames consisting of coupled walls with controlled energy dissipation mechanism have recently grabbed a lot of attentions since they take the advantage of both stiffness of RC walls and the ductility and energy dissipation capacity of steel components. The aim of this project is to develop and investigate a novel resilient structural system in which a self-centering mechanism is coupled with hybrid steel-concrete structural systems. Hence, the new system will be capable of resisting moderate to high intensity ground motions while both structural and non-structural damages are kept minimum simultaneously. Employment of this novel earthquake resilient structural system also leads to sustainable, fast and simple construction.",2022-02-01,2024-01-31,24.0,SIGNED,212933.76,212933.76,['energy'],,"['building', 'buildings']",2

Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) technology which converts wet organic feedstock into valuable carbonaceous products under pressurized conditions in a relatively mild temperature range (180-220 ̊C) has been suggested as a capable option for faecal waste treatment for those places in need. However, the technical and financial barriers hamper the practical implementation of the technology. In order to overcome these challenges, this research project aims to develop an appropriate low-cost HTC system for faecal waste treatment. Batch HTC reactors will be developed employing common pipe-fitting materials, and their standard operation regime will be established. Strategies for affording the energy demand of the system will be developed based on the products from previous treatments: combustion of solid material (hydrochar) and biogas generation from liquid material (process water). Also, basic properties of the hydrochar and process water will be investigated regarding their potential use as fuel, fertilizer and adsorbent.

This has led to predictions that are now considered useful for some societal applications over “hot-spot” land areas such as the Euro-Mediterranean. However, forecasts performance over land is still substantially weaker compared with ocean, due to the lack of observations, which has hampered the development of well-constrained land processes models. While benefiting from daily verification, the models used for the prediction of the short time-scales (from weather to seasons) include only that part of the surface variability for which observations are available and that can be modeled/initialized to positively contribute to the forecasts (verification-based approach). As a consequence, they unavoidably lack some processes such as those related to ecosystems and their variability. On the other hand, longer time-scales (interannual to centennial) models used for climate variability/change research contain comprehensive vegetation and soil schemes intended to represent as many processes as possible, even those that are still poorly constrained or understood. Through the synergy between process-based and verification-based approaches the ambitious objective of this project is to obtain a practicable seamless development across scales of the land modelling applied to Earth System predictions. The main goal will be to obtain verifiable land processes models to enhance the performance of the predictions across scales and to demonstrate unprecedented useful applications for the energy sector.

Damaging the reinforcement bars during the pile head removal can result in high financial loss, time waste and therefore, danger for the overall construction safety. Today’s solutions cannot guarantee a secure and efficient pile head removal, as they all apply vertical forces endangering the concrete structure. On top of that, high amounts of energy are lost during the operation and OPEX is very high.With Brextor we want to revolutionize the construction industry, by offering an innovative concrete pile milling head which applies horizontal forces to the pile and can thus control 100% the applied energy for an accurate and secure pile head removal minimizing the energy loss. Moreover, our method can guarantee an up to 4 times faster pile breaking at an up to 3.5 times lower OPEX. We also minimize the human risk factor as minimum worker intervention is required.

Overall, air treatment is responsible for 40% of total building energy consumption, and ventilation-related operations represent alone up to 26% of the electricity expenses. This is because current ventilation approaches consume huge amounts of energy by replacing indoor air with air from polluted outdoor environment. Thus, they need to choose between air quality and energy savings, so the better indoor air quality they achieve, the more energy spending, and the opposite way around. SALLY_R is a Swedish cleantech SME that has been awarded twice already for its disrupting innovation, s8AIR, an Air Handling Optimization System that guarantees optimum indoor air quality spending 40% less energy.

The EPC will enable the implementation of investments without or with limited public capital funding. EnerSHIFT project is based on the wish of the regional government to improve the quality of social housing buildings through retrofitting for the sake of low income people and to decrease energy consumption and related emissions while in the meantime boosting the local economy.The main concept underpinning the project is that economic shortages and public spending review do not currently make it possible to find budget for design and for investment. One good solution is the use of innovative financial schemes such as Energy Performance Contracting for the first time in whole Liguria. Besides, the success of this financial scheme can form the basis for other such investment programs, in Liguria, in other sectors or locations. Important to consider is that tenants do not own their homes but pay the bills – while the buildings are owned by SHOs which do not pay the bills. Therefore, any investment programme has to combine the objectives of both players. SHOs cannot implement measures without tenants approval, on the other hand, if tenants want to spend less and live better, they depend on the SHOs. One major point of the project is indeed the combination of these two interests with the help of the tenants syndicates who will involve tenants throughout the project.Therefore the EnerSHIFT project has energy, social and economic aims.",2016-02-01,2020-01-31,48.0,CLOSED,967687.5,967687.5,['energy'],['energy'],"['energy consumption', 'housing', 'urban', 'buildings']",4

The ranking system will assist the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport and Youth in Cyprus to the selection of school buildings for energy upgrade, based on environmental, energy, socioeconomic criteria. Upon finalization, the conduction of the energy audit will indicate the cost optimal energy interventions, which in turn will provide the technical specifications for the GPP. As a final step, the establishment of an EMS to the school buildings will ensure future energy savings and continuous improvement of energy performance.

The two main objectives of MiDER are: i) To develop a miniaturized and efficient multilevel converter (MMC) with GaN transistors and no magnetics, for grid-connected localized DERs. The advantageous characteristics of the GaN technology offer the foundations for the first monolithically integrated MMC on a single chip.ii) To study the advantages of eliminating magnetic components and filters in terms of dynamic response and power system stability.This novel approach is expected to result in efficiency improvement, notable weight and volume reduction and enhancement of the dynamic response of future DERs, while effectively addressing the oscillatory instabilities, commonly encountered during grid disturbances. The project is fully aligned with the EU policies for efficient energy generation from renewables and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and is anticipated to have a positive socioeconomic and environmental impact.The project lies between different scientific fields, extending from material science to power electronics and power system control, aiming to provide a collaborative solution for addressing the challenges of future converter-based networks.The Fellowship offers a unique opportunity to the Researcher to acquire new knowledge and personal development skills and bridge the gap between academia and industry, through cross-sectoral training and decentralised dissemination and communication activities across Europe.

PiDs are composite elements (piezoelectric+steel or rubber) located in the connections between buildings’ structural members and engaged by wind-induced oscillations to transform the kinetic energy of the oscillating structure into electricity. The concept of PiD is transformative as this will scale-up currently developed piezoelectric EH (pzEH) techniques at the micro and meso-scales to the truly macro scale. pzEH devices have never been implemented as structural connections in civil buildings for a number of reasons, such as the inadequacy of piezo materials in carrying loads and low frequencies of the vibrations occurring in buildings. These will be comprehensively addressed in SMART-UP by innovative in-parallel coupling schemes between piezo and the load-carrying members such as steel and/or rubber and by allowing the piezo-blocks working in nonlinear regimes arising from buckling or impact. These features will allow their implementation in buildings for powering wireless sensors provided for building automation, which leads to an increment of the building sustainability, and for structural-health monitoring, leading to an increase of the building resilience. Thanks to the introduction of these novel macroscale EH skills, the SMART-UP project makes a step-change in high-rise buildings design and management, by defining a new breed of tall SMART buildings with self-powering, adaptive-in-behavior capabilities.

Until now, most molecular self-assembled materials operate close to thermodynamic equilibrium, under static conditions, and are thus far from the interesting features biological living “materials” display. Biological materials are thermodynamically open and are kept far from equilibrium by a constant input of energy. This mode of self-assembly, one of the requirements of life, is referred to as dissipative or dynamic self-assembly. For this project I will focus on the recreation of part of such dissipative processes, and translating them to our current static hydrogel materials. With that, dynamic hydrogels with entirely new properties, most prominently their tunable lifetime and stiffness, will be developed. To do so, chemical fuels will be used as energy input and simple synthetic peptide derivatives will be constitute the self-assembling building blocks.  Not only will this project result in hydrogels with a tunable lifetime and stiffness, it also aims at setting new design guidelines and requirements to develop dynamic systems. Thereby it aims at aiding the scientific community as such rules currently lack, hampering the development of these interesting systems.The ambitious research project builds on what I have already accomplished working on thermodynamically static self-assembled systems and the expertise that the host group offers in terms of dynamic materials approach.

In our modern society, about 50% of the total energy consumption is used for heating and cooling. Growing demands for thermal management in many different sectors, from electronics to housing, inevitably means increased energy consumption. The primary source of heat is coming from the combustion of fossil, bio, or waste-based feedstocks, all contributing to emissions. This project seeks to fundamentally change how we generate heating and cooling by developing a new class of materials that capture, store, and release both solar and ambient heat. The solar thermal management materials are a unique combination of molecular photo-switches that capture and store sunlight, so-called MOST systems, together with phase change materials (PCM) that can contribute to thermal management. The two classes of materials operate at fundamentally different principles. The input of MOST system is photons, whereas the output is heat. The PCM materials can absorb heat from the environment. By combining the two materials into one, we can harness and upgrade two of the most abundant renewable sources of energy on the planet: ambient heat and sunlight. The materials function will be demonstrated in heat to power devices that can operate 24/7 without the need for traditional batteries. The MOST-PCM combination has the potential to disrupt how we control the temperature in a broad range of applications, from local power production to heating and cooling in electronics systems, to temperature control in automotive and housing.  The materials developed in this project have the potential to radically change thermal comfort and energy consumption and give new design opportunities to thermal management systems from the 10-9 to 10 m length scale.",2021-10-01,2026-09-30,60.0,SIGNED,2000000.0,2000000.0,['energy'],,"['energy consumption', 'housing']",2

Upgrading the existing masonry EU buildings is becoming progressively more important due to: (1) their poor seismic performance during recent earthquakes (i.e. Italy, Greece) that have resulted in significant economic losses, severe injuries and loss of human lives; and (2) their low energy performance which increases significantly their energy consumption (buildings are responsible for 40% of EU energy consumption). Since replacing the existing buildings with new is prohibitively expensive and has also huge environmental and social impact, their lifetime extension requires considering both seismic and energy retrofitting. It is noted that the annual cost of repair and maintenance of existing European building stock is estimated to be about 50% of the total construction budget, currently standing at more than €300 billion. To achieve cost effectiveness, SPEctRUM explores a novel approach, proposing for the first time a hybrid structural-plus-energy retrofitting solution which combines inorganic textile-based composites with thermal insulation systems for masonry building envelopes. The effectiveness of the proposed retrofitting system will be validated experimentally and analytically.

30572,FACADE FIRE,Numerical characterisation of fire growth in external facades and other vertical spaces,655138,"Fire growth through spreading up the façade of high-rise buildings can lead to catastrophic loss of life and property. Façades at times are required to have a fire-resistance rating, for instance, if two buildings are very close together, to lower the likelihood of fire spreading from one building to another. The issue is becoming increasingly critical due to new development trends involving higher buildings and sometime in close proximity to each other and the increasing use of combustible material in façade to raise energy performance of buildings. The proposed Fellowship is aimed at investigating numerically the behaviour of flames ejected from enclosure fires in external facades and other vertical spaces such as atrium, void spaces and staircases. Full understanding of such external flame behaviour requires insight of the combustion processes within the enclosure. Hence the scope of the research includes enclosure fires to characterise the ejected flames as well as fire growth in façades. The research will take advantage of the abundant experimental data available for model validation.  The specific objectives include: 1. Fine tune and validate the open source CFD code FireFOAM , a dedicated LES based solver for fire simulation within the OpenFOAM® toolbox for enclosure fires; 2. Investigate the combustion and aerothermodynamics of enclosure fires, including travelling fires; 3.

Photovoltaic energy is called to play a major role in the world’s electricity production in the mid-term. The present market-dominant technology, crystalline silicon, has reached its practical efficiency record of 26% and the energy cost of this technology seems to be stagnating now. For these reasons, research on new ways of increasing the conversion efficiency of solar cells is still extensive. Among the proposed novel concepts for high-efficiency solar cells, the intermediate band solar cell (IBSC) has received great attention by the scientific community. In conventional single-gap solar cells, photons with energy lower than the bandgap of the absorber material are wasted. The IBSC concept allows harvesting below-bandgap photons without voltage loss, which increases the limiting efficiency from 33% to 50%. So far, IBSCs have been realized with epitaxially-grown quantum dot (QD) superlattices of III-V semiconductors. However, no pronounced efficiency enhancement has been yet reported, since this technological approach is unable to produce nanostructured materials with the properties required theoretically. In particular, epitaxial QDs exhibit low absorbance, leading to low photocurrent, and weak quantum confinement, which degrades the voltage of the cell. Recently, a new type of solution-processed semiconductor materials, quantum dots in a perovskite host (CQDs@Perovskite), has been demonstrated. The intrinsic opto-electronic properties of CQDs@Perovskite (high absorbance & strong quantum confinement) make them perfect candidates as absorber material in IBSCs. ENLIGHTEN will exploit CQDs@Perovskite materials combined with microstructure-based light trapping techniques to pave the way for low-cost high-efficiency solar cells. In addition, the cells have an innovative device structure compatible with flexible-substrate technology.",2020-12-01,2022-12-31,25.0,SIGNED,147815.04,147815.04,['energy'],,"['climate', 'community']",2
30881,NOMAD,Novel Organic recovery using Mobile ADvanced technology,863000,"NOMAD gathers partners from China, Greece, the UK, Italy, Romania, Malta and the Netherlands to develop an innovative, small-scale tech solution designed to recover fibre and specific nutrients from digestate for formulation into high performance bio-fertiliser products. It addresses key digestate issues including environmental and health risks, handling, variable composition and the increasing volume being produced. Currently, turning digestate into bio-fertiliser products is not feasible for most small plants due to lack of available, cost-effective equipment, and the expense of achieving end of waste standard PAS110. Building on partners’ previous work, the proposed technology will utilise heat from combustion of waste timber and recovered energy from a collection vehicle to improve energy efficiency while simultaneously addressing regulatory compliance. Specific nutrients will be extracted from the liquid fraction and water recovered for reuse. The remaining sludge will be blended & composted with ash (derived from waste timber combustion) and biochar to produce optimised, nutrient-balanced soil conditioners. The model rests on the solution’s mobility and modularity as one unit could serve multiple plants, tackling digestate from a range of feedstocks with shared costs making it more viable than installing systems at individual plants.Other project activities include stakeholder engagement; field trials across contrasting regions; policy recommendations; a comprehensive impact assessment of the business model; and dissemination of key outputs. The project aims to replace non-renewable mineral fertilisers with low-carbon, organic equivalents; minimise environmental and health risks associated with digestate; create a new, disruptive business model for rural decentralised AD; and achieve a more favourable climate for circular economy development through successful stakeholder engagement.",2019-10-01,2022-09-30,36.0,SIGNED,4250477.0,5499857.01,['energy'],,"['building', 'climate']",2

Svelte uses a proprietary, unique, innovative machine system to generate all types of curved surfaces on an industrial scale, in one straightforward operation, at a fraction of the cost and time of current methods. Svelte works on a patented advanced cutting method using a heated SmartWire that changes its shape while moving through foam or wax-based materials to generate the desired surfaces.Svelte disrupts the currently used CNC milling processes similarly to how 3D printers impacted the prototyping industry, pushing the boundaries of what is possible today to change architecture as we know it. A Svelte produced mould is at least 50% cheaper than a regular milled mould and has the ability to be mass produced in minutes, making the output of a single Svelte system equivalent to approximately 48 CNC machines. Svelte will therefore enable for the first time growth in the emerging special buildings niche to achieve the spectacular, innovative, energy efficient fluid forms of the future; but also generate substantial savings in the traditional building sector. Integrating Svelte cut shapes in existing building projects preserves their structural integrity, but uses up to 30% less construction materials, adding up to significant savings in energy, water, sand, CO2, coal, methane, NOX, and PM10 particles in Europe’s most polluting industry.Having confirmed Svelte’s market acceptance and potential during the SME Instrument Phase 1 project, the focus is now on bringing the technology to TRL 9 during the proposed EIC project. In this scope we envision the optimization of the machine’s cutting function and prepare it for scaling to commence commercialization under both a FIAB model, but also as a SaaS solution producing moulds and panels in our own production facility.",2021-01-01,2022-12-31,24.0,SIGNED,1669648.75,2385213.0,['energy'],,"['building', 'buildings']",2

For that, it applies a twofold strategy: 1)persuades users to increase their energy-awareness and change their e-consumption habits and 2)embeds intelligence in the devices to let them autonomously decide about their operation mode for energy efficiency purposes. For the first part, it will use a variety of techniques, from persuasive social applications to physical interaction mechanisms linked to the devices. For the second part, it will learn from the usage habits, acting only when an energy wasteful behaviour is detected or the users do not heed the devices’ suggestions. The aim is to add a green-soul to devices in a pluggable manner to avoid costly replacement of equipment and the corresponding disposal of old-fashioned devices to the landfill. GreenSoul’s exploitation potential is addressed towards buildings of public use. There, the persuasion of users is particularly challenging since they hardly perceive the benefits of having eco-friendly behaviour, i.e. they do not pay the electricity bill. GreenSoul will design and develop an integrated ICT platform to: a) improve users awareness of their energy consumption habits; b)study the ecological behaviour of the people in shared environments; c)analyse the effectiveness of different persuasion techniques; d)assist users through a decision-support engine’s recommendations; and e)provide socio-economic evidence about the viability of the changes proposed.

Carbon felts, which are the most commonly used electrodes for AORFBs, will be modified in order to enhance the interactions between the electrode and the electrolytes to further improve the performance of the batteries. Two routes of modifications will be explored: i) pulse-electrodeposition of metals on carbon felt electrodes using a flow-through system and ii) electrografting of organic modifiers via the aryl diazonium salts method.  By optimising the properties of the electrodes in terms of specific surface area, wettability, local pH and charge transfer, positive impacts on the power and energy densities and efficiencies of the battery are expected. Therefore, the objectives are threefold: i) to develop novel carbon felt electrodes modified by electrodeposition and electrografting, ii) to study the performance and durability of the modified electrodes for AORFBs application, via the optimisation of the electrode/electrolyte interactions, iii) to upscale (from 25 cm² up to 2100 cm²) the electrode surface modification process and to implement and test the corresponding electrodes in pilot-scale reactors. By developing novel modified carbon felts, this fellowship aims at improving the performance and stability of AORFBs. This will help Kemiwatt pursue their technological development and achieve their goals by 2023.

What if we could utilize natural processes and assemble such a material, monolayer by monolayer with exquisite control over the resulting electronic structure. HeteroPlates will address these challenges using halide perovskite two dimensional nanoplates as building blocks and test beds for these ideas. Metal halide perovskite are exciting the scientific community with high conversion efficiency and ease of device processability. But this is a double edge sword since it deems long term device stability an ongoing challenge, especially where perovskites interface other materials and create heterostructures.Perovskite heterostructures play a crucial role, they influence electronic structure and affect device functionality, efficiency and most importantly stability. It is therefore critical to understand hetero-epitaxial growth and develop methods to create perovskite heterostructures and interfaces in a controlled fashion and characterize them at these length scales. My research program HeteroPlates will employ a bottom-up approach, taking advantage of the natural stability of colloidal 2D nanoplates, their atomically flat surfaces and tendency to self-organize. By means of colloidal synthesis, perovskite will grow, be grown and self -assembled into uniform monolayer controlled heterostructures. Using specially developed characterization methods we will achieve ground breaking control over imaging resolution of heterostructures.These methods will be employed to create Proof-of-concept devices with new functionalities, aiming for translation of knowledge and methodologies garnered from colloidal heterostructures to higher hierarchy devices, serving future generations.",2021-03-01,2026-02-28,60.0,SIGNED,1872500.0,1872500.0,['energy'],,"['building', 'community']",2

This assemblage is known as the Gut Microbiome and has received increased attention over the last decade. Scientists have begun to uncover the importance of these bacterial inhabitants and expand investigations to consider how site-specific microbiomes affect host physiology. While more than one million cholecystectomies (gallbladder removal surgeries) are performed throughout Europe each year, the bacterial communities associated with the human gallbladder and its disease states remain unknown. Studies are lacking that characterize the effects of cholecystectomies on the gut microbiome. Without the ability to regulate bile entering the duodenum during food intake, it is expected that gallbladder removal will lead to downstream changes in the intestinal population. Here, the microbial composition of human bile, gallbladder mucosa, and biopsies of surgically removed healthy gallbladders (adherent and non-adherent microbiota) will be investigated using 16S rRNA metagenomics. The profiles will be compared to samples of a second cohort undergoing emergency cholecystectomies, in order to identify possible biomarkers for gallbladder disease. Once the gallbladder microbiome has been elucidated, the impact of its removal on the gut microbiome will be assessed. Using molecular and cultivation based techniques, on stool samples (collected during the recovery period) and analyzed for community composition, metabolomics, bile, fat and energy content.

This focus on static and isothermal states has been translated in the prescription of fixed set-point temperatures in buildings. Now, a paradigm shift in the way energy is generated and used calls for a complete rethink of the way buildings are designed and operated. In contrast to a fixed set-point driven design, the implementation of set-point modulations in buildings allows to shift and/or shave heating and cooling peak loads and contributes to boost buildings’ flexibility. However, a scarce knowledge of the effect of dynamic indoor conditions on occupants’ thermal comfort still prevents the design and adoption of comfortable temperature fluctuations. While big advancements have been made in modelling the physics of the heat and mass transfer into and out of the human body (i.e. the passive system of multi-segmental dynamic models of human thermoregulation), still very little is known on how the brain processes and integrates sensory inputs to create thermal perceptions, particularly during dynamic indoor conditions. The proposed research project aims to address this knowledge deficit by shedding new light on the psycho-physiological mechanisms driving the dynamic thermal perception, with a particular focus on the phenomena of thermal alliesthesia and thermal adaptation, and by creating a more accurate predictive thermal comfort model, which is able to better account for these two phenomena. This project will provide the research community with a new robust set of empirical data, novel knowledge and a novel physiological-based dynamic thermal comfort model, which has the potential to revolutionize the way professionals and researchers design and operate indoor comfort systems: not just aiming for thermal neutrality but striving for thermal delight.",2021-03-01,2023-08-31,30.0,SIGNED,220958.88,220958.88,['energy'],,"['buildings', 'community']",2

We strongly believe that this is a result of looking in the wrong direction. The cool innov project will achieve this breakthrough by rethinking the whole concept of caloric cooling. We are rejecting the conventional idea of squeezing the best out of magneto-structural phase-change materials in relatively low magnetic fields, and instead we introduce a second stimulus in the form of pressure so that we can exploit, rather than avoid, the hysteresis that is inherent in these materials. The hysteresis will allow us to lock-in the magnetisation at saturation as the magnetising field is removed, so that magnetic fields persisting over a large area will no longer be required (instead, we can use a very focused field), and then demagnetise the material in a second step with an applied stress, enabling us to extract a lot more heat. In this case we only need to apply the magnetic field to a small volume of material, making it a completely new application for commercially available, high-temperature, YBCO-type, bulk superconducting permanent magnets. With the high-field, multi-stimuli approach proven, we will develop new magneto/mechanocaloric materials that match the new high-field, hysteresis-positive approach and start to fabricate novel heat-exchanger structures using additive manufacturing, so that we can combine a mechanically sound heat exchanger having a complex geometry with locally tailored, magneto/mechanocaloric properties.

The key idea behind CONSEED is to understand how consumers make decisions which involve an energy component, and to make (energy) operating costs more salient to consumers at the point of purchase to increase efficient behaviour.

Recent progress in nanotechnology has enabled developing such optical metamaterials (OMMs) economically via controlled self-assembly of nanoparticles (NPs). Strikingly, a dense nanometre-thick layer of metallic NPs strongly reflects incident light like a ‘mirror’, whereas a sparse layer enacts a near-transparent ‘window’. Thus OMMs could form a switchable mirror–window to minimize our energy needs by harvesting light. Besides tuneable-optics, dense OMMs could revolutionise sensing of trace-analytes for detecting threats to our health, safety, and security. I aim to develop new means of dynamic control over resulting NP-layer architecture to make OMMs ‘smart’, for novel applications like fast-programmable mirrors, -tuneable optical-filters and -cavities.  But achieving quick alteration of NP architectures for fast-tuneable optical response is very challenging. Voltage-controlled assembly and disassembly of NPs at interfaces between liquid electrolyte and solid electrodes could be one efficient method. However, these processes are often diffusion-limited, making OMMs slow to respond. This requires the desired systems to be confined, or miniaturized, by developing new schemes and custom-made architectures to ensure assembly/disassembly occurs within sub-second timescales. To achieve this, I will engage novel electrode designs—patterned as rectangular-groove gratings, columnar structures, and flat transparent plates—where NPs can rearrange quickly on desired areas of the electrodes to either reflect or transmit light.

32916,DAMOSET,With data-driven modelling towards a successful energy transition,840825,"The power grid is an integral part of the power system. It connects all electrical consumers with generators and powers everything from household appliances to large factory machinery. Without this grid, farmers would not be able to feed their animals, car factories would come to a halt, mobile phone systems would fail and many of us would not even be able to make a cup of tea. While the current power system is very reliable and offers a high quality of service, it remains unclear how this will develop in the future. The limited supply of fossil fuels as well as necessary reduction of CO2 emissions to mitigate climate change, will eventually lead to a power grid mainly supplied by renewable generators, such as wind and solar plants. These plants output smaller total power so that a large number is necessary which have to be geographically distributed for optimal weather conditions. The current power grid system slowly emerged within several decades of optimization processes. However, now we are discussing how to revolutionize the whole energy system within years. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of the current power system is necessary to develop potential pathways to a future 100% sustainable system. In the proposed research, I will use data-driven approaches to work towards a quantitative understanding of fluctuations in the power grid, as they are for example introduced by the changing demand or volatile energy generation. I will analyse the British as well as international grids to understand differences in grid operation and potential solutions for grids. A key goal of the proposed project is to offer a data base of these measurements for the scientific community to analyse and to add to.

Decarbonisation of existing buildings plays a key role in order to reach the overall climate protection targets. However, current renovation rates lie in the order of 1%.  Heat pumps are a key technology in bringing renewable shares into heat supply of buildings; especially their combination with onsite renewable electricity production e.g. by PV allows to bring high renewable shares. Their current installation in existing multi-apartment buildings is however still marginal. The proposed technological solution is based on decentralized heat pumps, in such a way that it results an easy-to-install solution for installers, low-intrusive for the occupants and easily adaptable to a large number of different building situations. This is flanked by developing near-zero planning, implementation and operation processes, in order to facilitate the work during the planning phase, ensure a high-quality installation and effective operation, and reduce the efforts and costs within the whole retrofitting project. The challenge of cost-competitiveness is addressed by developing new financial and business models. Bringing new players (such as financial experts) and financing models to the renovation market is expected to bring the needed paradigm change and boost investments in the residential retrofitting sector. Dissemination of measured performance and system characteristics from HAPPENING will be one of the key results of the project.Through 3 demo sites (Spain, Italy and Austria), the project will demonstrate a highly versatile, scalable and replicable solution package for buildings energy system retrofitting allowing 70-75% of renewable energy fraction, 30-50% of PE and GHG savings, reduction of planning time by 50% and installation/operation time by 30% and payback time for ESCOs and investors of less than 8 years, compared to best available solution existing today.",2020-10-01,2024-03-31,42.0,SIGNED,2499669.63,2955700.0,['energy'],['energy'],"['building', 'climate', 'energy demand', 'buildings']",4

The design and control of such networks is becoming increasingly complex, due to their growing size, heterogeneity and autonomy. A systematic theory and methodology for control of large-scale interconnected systems is therefore needed. In an ambitious effort towards this goal, this project will develop rigorous tools for control synthesis, adaptation and verification. Many large-scale systems exhibit properties that have not yet been systematically exploited by the control community. One such property is positive (or monotone) system dynamics. This correspond to the property that all states of a network respond in the same direction when the demand or supply is perturbed in some node. Scalable methods for control of positive systems are starting to be developed, but several fundamental questions remain: How can existing results be extended to scalable synthesis of dynamic controllers? Can results for linear positive systems be extended to nonlinear monotone ones? How about systems with resonances? The second focus area, adaptation, takes advantage of recent progress in machine learning, such as statistical concentration bounds and approximate dynamic programming. Adaptation is of fundamental importance for scalability, since high-fidelity models are very expensive to generate manually and hard to maintain. Thirdly, since systematic procedures for control synthesis generally rely on simplified models and idealized assumptions, we will also develop scalable methods to bound the effect of imperfections, such as nonlinearities, time-variations and parameter uncertainty that are not taken into account in the original design.

In harbor cities ship emissions are often a leading source of urban pollution and, in particular, fine particulate matter (PM). When ships are docked, they use their engines and/or generators to power onboard systems and equipments, generating substantial pollution in port areas. In this context, Shore connection technology is emerging as the most cost-effective means of reducing pollution from ships at berth, as it eliminates ships’ need to run their engines by providing electricity directly from the electric grid. In fact, EU recommendation 2006/336/EC highlights shore connection as the optimal solution in terms of both cost savings and pollution control.Traditionally, high cost on integrating and operating shore connection service into the harbour, along with frequent overload incidents, causing personal and material damage, have hampered its wide adoption.eTactica is positioned at this market gap. eTactica is an Iceland based company founded in 2009 with the aim to provide the most accurate control and information over energy consumption.eTactica’s Shore Connection Solution (SCS) is an energy monitoring, control, and communications system that streamlines the connection and invoicing process.The SCS utilizes our patented current meter bar.

33302,OCAL,Optimal Control at Large,787845,"""Despite wide ranging progress on both the theory and applications of optimal control for more than half a century, considerable challenges remain when it comes to applying the resulting methods to large scale systems. The difficulties become even greater when one moves outside the classical realm of model based optimal control to address problems where models are replaced by data, or macroscopic behaviours emerge out of microscopic interactions of large populations of agents. To address these challenges, we propose here to develop a framework for approximating optimal control problems using randomised optimisation. The starting point will be formulations of optimal control problems as infinite dimensional linear programs. Our recent work suggests that randomised methods on the one hand can serve as a basis for algorithms to approximate such infinite programs and on the other enjoy close connections to statistical learning theory, providing a direct link to data driven approaches. Turning these intuitions into an approximation framework for optimal control that rests on solid theoretical foundations and provides explicit accuracy guarantees will be the methodological contribution of the proposed research. The resulting methods can find a range of applications in engineering and beyond; here we will investigate two such applications. One is motivated by our work on energy management in buildings and districts. The challenge here is the dimensionality of the system, especially if one would like to include weather and other forecast information and the corresponding uncertainty. The second application will be to so-called population systems, that involve the interaction of many agents with local decision-making capabilities coupled through the use of common resources.

In winter, heating energy demand of buildings with high windows-to-wall ratio (WWR) in north- and east direction is up to 35% higher compared to buildings with only small windows. In summer, large windows and glass facades result in high heating of the building interior: cooling energy demand is increased by a factor ≈ 1.5 to 5 when WWR increases from 10% to 90%. Non-residential buildings often make use of large windows or glass facades for building-functional and representative reasons and therefore hardly suffer from increased energy demand. Switch2save targets active management of radiation energy transfer through glass-based building envelopes by integrating transparent energy smart materials with switchable total energy transmission values (g-value).

The high level of porosity in the eco-LWG will allow them to absorb and retain much higher levels of PCM than has previously been possible using existing lightweight aggregates. Both the eco-LWG and the PCM loaded eco-LWG will be optimised by statistical design methodology and they will be used to develop new energy efficient construction products. Two impregnation methods will be compared to introduce the PCM into the eco-LWG: vacuum sorption to achieve maximum PCM uptake and short term immersion to partially fill the connected porosity. These will produce innovative lightweight and high heat-storage materials. Incorporating PCM loaded granules in mortars and other construction materials will result in reduced energy requirements to heat and cool buildings and improve indoor living conditions. The eco-LWG developed in this research will also be used in green roofs to provide water retention capacity and slow nutrient release. Green roofs can reduce the energy requirements of buildings and urban pollution. This multidisciplinary innovative research will deliver new energy efficient construction materials that can contribute to achieving the 2020 target of nearly zero-energy and highly material efficient buildings, which is an essential target to achieve sustainable growth in the EU.",2015-08-01,2017-07-31,24.0,CLOSED,183454.8,183454.8,['energy'],['energy'],"['energy consumption', 'housing', 'urban', 'buildings']",4

Aerogel building materials are characterized by very low thermal conductivities and ideal physical properties in building applications both in retrofits and new constructions. While several products have been developed and become commercially available in the last decade, knowledge with building professionals - such as architects, building designers, engineers and owners on their successful practical application in different contexts is still sparse. This hinders the implementation of available solutions as well as the development of new ones based on aerogels, which have the potential to play a significant role in the reduction of energy consumption in buildings and thus in meeting EU climate and energy goals. It is hence proposed, in a first work package (WP1), to document and analyse the usage of aerogel building materials in Switzerland and the EU by studying and measurement of realised retrofits and applications in new buildings. This data and its analysis will be made available within an online data base.

Especially, cities are creating the conditions for health problems, such as sedentary lifestyles, unhealthy diets, air and other pollutions and stress. On the other hand, cities also offer opportunities for structural and long-lasting healthy transformations in lifestyles and health status. However, the big question is how to achieve these transformations in a situation where complexity of urban health problems is increasing, involving many actors. Increasingly, it is recognized that disciplinary and sectoral approaches no longer suffice but that an integrated, holistic approach toward the physical, social and institutional factors that shape urban health and health inequalities is necessary.

The vast number of alternative choices enhances the possibility of arriving at an optimum with the incorporation of smart, automatic tools in the design process, further guiding designer’s intuition.The principal aim of the proposed Network is to create and test methodologies for the application of optimization techniques in different design phases of civil structures by developing strong synergies among a multi-disciplinary team of academic experts from Greece, France, Cyprus, Canada, Turkey, Egypt & Jordan and SMEs from France & Greece.A first goal of the project is to exploit the use of shape and topology optimization techniques in computer aided architectural design. Moreover, the Network wants to exchange ideas, propose formulations that correspond to real-life applications and develop solutions for optimal multi-disciplinary architectural design. Of particular interest is the combination of criteria deriving from structural mechanics, eco-design, bioclimatic design and acoustic performance.For each topic, joint workshops, seminars and long-term visits will be organized at the coordinating and partner institutions. The results will be published in scientific journals, professional magazines and presented in international conferences.""",2016-02-01,2020-01-31,48.0,CLOSED,1620000.0,1620000.0,['energy'],,"['building', 'smart', 'buildings']",3

The project aims at accelerating development and application of hybrid resorption heat pump for more energy efficient use of heat. A recast of European Performance of Buildings Directive indicated that higher energy efficiency is required for heating and cooling in building and industrial sector. Heat pumps can provide such efficient use, among which sorption heat pump could be a promising candidate. Due to various sorption working pairs, the heat with a wide temperature range could be recovered which almost saves 50% energy through desorption and sorption process compared to direct heating systems. So far, this technology has not been commercially realized in large-scale application or served as an auxiliary application. The project objectives are elaborated as follows:1. Screen potential thermo-chemical sorbents with higher energy density through comprehensive review, develop and test the promising composite materials.2. Develop a transient model for hybrid resorption heat pumps.3. Design, construct and test a pair of resorption reactors that can operate over 1000+ cycles without noticeable loss of reactivity, and to be integrated with compressor for completing resorption system.4. Conduct techno-economic analysis of hybrid heat pump for real industrial application.This proposal combines the applicant’s expertise concerning heat/mass transfer and reaction kinetics of sorbents with thermal engineering skills & experience of Dr. Carlos Infante Ferreira at TUDelft to achieve the high energy efficient sorption heat pump.

33916,THORAX,NEXT GENERATION OF ADVANCED COMPOSITE MATERIALS FOR SUSTAINABLE RETROFITTING OF STRUCTURES,892406,"Owing to the poor seismic design and the absence of strict energy performance regulations, the vast majority of the existing old building stock in seismic-prone areas is not only highly vulnerable to earthquakes, but also energy demanding. Currently, structural and energy retrofitting of buildings is treated separately with no established holistic approach. An integrated retrofitting system using advanced composite materials combined with thermal insulation can improve the seismic and energy performance of buildings and offer savings in application costs (>25%). During the last two decades, the use of fibre-reinforced composite materials for structural retrofitting applications has gained popularity. The recent generations of advanced composites for construction have proven to be very effective in seismic retrofitting of structures. However, they are often expensive, lead to incompatibility issues, and promote the use of cement-based binders, of which the production largely contributes to the global CO2 emissions (5% of global man-made CO2 emissions). The main objective of THORAX is to develop the next generation of sustainable fibre-reinforced composite materials to be used for the combined structural and energy retrofitting of buildings, protecting the residents during earthquakes, whilst increasing their energy performance. The efficiency of this novel retrofitting system will be investigated through a multi-scale experimental campaign accompanied with a detailed numerical investigation.

ESCAPE-2 also invests in significantly more productive programming models for the weather-climate community through which novel algorithm development will be accelerated and future-proofed. Eventually, the project aims at providing exascale-ready production benchmarks to be operated on extreme-scale demonstrators (EsD) and beyond.

This concept has at its foundation, a set of cost-attractive, environmentally friendly, multi-functional and easily applicable building-related innovations, grouped into: a) plug-n-play, modular building envelope solutions and b) RES, hybrid and storage solutions. RINNO couples the above with innovative retrofitting processes, methods and tools, characterized by low tenants’ disruption.

34005,AT2,Asynchronous Trustworthy Transactions,862082,"Although Nakamoto’s original blockchain protocol has spurred significant innovation and financial interest in the last decade, its energy consumption  becomes problematic. Besides, transaction latencies are prohibitively high and the system sustains a very low throughput. We have witnessed hundreds of alternative solutions in the last decade. Each seeks to reduce energy consumption, to obtain lower latency, or to improve throughput. All proposed alternatives, however, sacrifice either trustworthiness or efficiency. In retrospect, this is not surprising. All these solutions seek to solve a notoriously difficult problem: consensus. In short, the set of nodes in the network have to agree on the same position of a block in the chain, despite the possibility of malicious behaviour of some of the nodes, or network delays. The consensus problem has been the most studied problem in distributed computing, and many impossibility and lower bound results were established. These results translate into inherent trade-offs between trust and efficiency.  In the context of our ERC AOC (Adversary-Oriented Computing) project (advanced grant), we worked on classifying distributed computing problems according to their hardness. While doing so, we revisited the issue of implementing a trustworthy payment system, i.e., the problem solved in Nakamoto’s paper.  This led us to a very interesting discovery: Current blockchain protocols are tackling a problem, i.e., consensus, which is unnecessarily strong for their purpose of building a payment system. More specifically, we have shown that it is enough to solve a problem called secure causal broadcast to implement trust in any tokenized application. This is significantly simpler than consensus. We devised a generic asynchronous protocol to solve the secure causal broadcast problem, which we called AT2, Asynchronous Trustworthy Transactions, which we patented.

To go beyond the conventional commercially available superconducting (SC) magnets, very large infrastructures such as the ones gathered within the European Magnetic Field Laboratory (EMLFL) are necessary. EMFL provides access to static resistive magnets (up to 38 T) and pulsed non-destructive (up to 100 T) and semi-destructive (up to 200 T) magnets for all qualified European researchers. Some recent advances open the way for the implementation of high temperature superconductor (HTS) magnets at the EMFL facilities. The SuperEMFL design study aims to add through the development of the HTS technology an entirely new dimension to the EMFL that go beyond the commercial offer, providing the European high field user community with much higher SC fields and novel SC magnet geometries, like large-bore-high-flux magnets or radial access magnets.The development of SC magnets that can partly replace current high-field resistive magnets will result in a significant reduction of the energy consumption of the static field EMFL facilities. This will strongly improve EMFL’s financial and ecological sustainability and at the same time boost its scientific performance and impact. The high field values, the very low noise and vibration levels, and the possibility to run very long duration experiments will make high SC magnetic fields attractive to scientific communities that so far have rarely used the EMFL facilities (NMR, scanning probe, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies, ultra-low temperature physics,  electro-chemistry …).

Energy System Models (ESM) are tools that help energy analysts, planners and policy makers to rationally describe energy systems and systematically evaluate the impacts of long-term scenarios. On the supply side, ESMs have provided useful results, but  however, on the demand side, they lack the degree of accuracy required for proper characterization of, among others, the use of energy in households. One of the intrinsic difficulties is that energy demand in the residential sector is influenced by a myriad of factors (like the high diversity of dwellings, socio-economic conditions of the social/family units, and behavioral-related consumption patterns) that cannot easily be accounted for in traditional ESMs.To overcome this challenge, the novel Causal Modeling will be used to quantitatively analyse human decision making in energy consumption and their reactions to interventions (e.g. policy changes).

As these processes occur in 3D, urban applications require 3D data and each application requires its own specific semantic and geometric Level of Detail (LoD) of the 3D data.The scientific challenge of this project is that it requires enormous efforts to collect and transform 3D data to make it suitable for a specific application. Urban applications are therefore forced to work mainly in 2D. This reduction causes the loss of important information. A solution is needed to support the reuse of once collected 3D data in multiple applications.I will develop a fundamental solution for providing 3D data at application specific LoDs to solve the current problem of independently acquired and stored LoDs of a 3D urban model. To enforce consistency across dimensions, the LoDs will be modelled as an extra dimension to the 3D spatial dimensions in an integrated 3D+LoD (4D) model. I will use an innovative method that goes far beyond the state-of-the-art by introducing higher dimensional (nD) mathematical models to the well-established domain of cartographic generalisation in 2D. Furthermore, I will study 3D generalisation solutions to derive coarse from fine data and embed these in the 4D model. “Slicing” operations will be developed that reduce the dimensions of the 4D data to generate error-free 3D data at application specific LoDs.LoD is strongly related to map scale, a well-known concept in GIS. However, modelling it as an extra dimension of geographic data is new. In addition, the intermediate results have the potential to advance the field of geo-information technology, such as the ground-breaking extension of the 2D cartographic generalisation domain to 3D.

34639,Green-Combustion,Addressing challenging issues for turbulent premixed hydrogen combustion modeling using novel technologies,101025581,"Hydrogen is enjoying a renewed and rapidly growing attention in Europe and around the world. The most important advantage of hydrogen usage is that it does emit greenhouse gases. The EU's priority is to develop renewable hydrogen where the H2 is produced from the electrolysis of water, with the electricity stemming from renewable energy. This meets the goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. There are two options for hydrogen usage. One is the drop-in approach, where only a limited amount of H2 can be added to the fossil fuel to reuse the existing chambers, due to the very different properties of H2. However, this option still emits a large amount of greenhouse gases. The other one is to redesign the existing chambers to burn substantial H2. The most challenging issues for burning substantial H2 are the strong differential diffusion and its induced instabilities. The state-of-the-art combustion model cannot capture these phenomena with accuracy, particularly when they further interact with turbulence. The aim of this proposal is to develop and validate such a model to close this gap. The model will be based on a flamelet approach, and a novel machine learning technology will be introduced to consider the differential diffusion (objective 1). To model the positive and negative curvatures in the unstable premixed H2 flame, a novel flamelet model will be developed based on the detailed a priori and a posteriori analyses of the state-of-the-art DNS datasets (objective 2). Finally, the developed flamelet model will be extended to LES with the differential diffusion and curvature related sub-grid scale (SGS) effects being considered with the artificially thickened flame (ATF) model. Particularly, the SGS effects will be considered by modifying the efficiency function. LES will be conducted for the DNS configuration and a turbulent methane flame with substantial H2 addition using the developed flamelet model coupled with the modified ATF approach (objective 3).",2021-09-01,2023-08-31,24.0,SIGNED,178320.0,178320.0,['energy'],,"['positive', 'net-zero']",2
